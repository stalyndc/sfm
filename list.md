Based on list.md, here are practical features we can tackle next:

Harden parsing: add a richer fallback extractor for infinite scroll/paginated pages and lazy-loaded images so feeds stay complete.

Smarter feedback: surface meaningful parser errors and let users tweak grab settings (items-per-page, CSS selectors) before giving up.

Feed enrichment: detect optional metadata—author, publish date, images, tags—and include it when available to improve downstream reader display.

Compliance guardrails: integrate automated RSS/JSON-feed validation plus robots.txt checks to keep generated feeds standards-friendly and respectful.

Usage insight: log and expose lightweight feed analytics (refresh counts, last success/failure) so creators can monitor reach and reliability.

UI polish: add a preview/test mode with saved history or favorites, helping returning users re-run their most common feeds without reconfiguration.
