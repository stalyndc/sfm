Programming language expertise of mine is deeply rooted in a solid C/C++ background; nevertheless, nowadays I specialize in Java, enjoying it on a daily basis for over a decade now. I aim for a systematic mindset, valuing efficiency and reliability while creating meaningful innovations for organizations across various sectors/fields/industries. In addition, I believe in the role and responsibility of science and technology in fostering positive social change, and I would like to contribute to this effort.</i><button onclick=readNotes() class=jump-button>Read Notes</button><h3>CONTACT:</h3><a href=mailto:aisetayeshi@duck.com>aisetayeshi@duck.com</a><br><small><i>note: @duck is an official alias offered by DuckDuckGo:<a href=https://duckduckgo.com/email/>duckduckgo.com/email/</a>.</i></small><h3>LABS</h3><small><i>in-progress experiments during my spare time</i></small><br><ul><li><strong>cronify</strong>: A lightweight job scheduling service designed to operate efficiently on non-persistent Linux machines.
