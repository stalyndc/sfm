          <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>Donald Trump has responded to viral online rumours about his death, saying he was unaware the false reports were taking off on social media while he was out of the public spotlight in recent days.</p><p>&quot;I didn&#x27;t hear that one,&quot; the US president said after a reporter raised the issue at a White House press conference.</p><p>&quot;That&#x27;s pretty serious.&quot;</p><p>In another example of a false conspiracy rapidly spreading on social media — assisted by algorithms that reward hysteria over accuracy — hashtags such as #trumpdead and #whereistrump began trending over America&#x27;s Labor Day long weekend.</p><p>The unfounded theories that Mr Trump had died were fuelled by his week-long break from public engagements and recent images of his bruised hands and swollen ankles.</p><p>Some posts speculating about his health were rewarded with more than a million views.</p><p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker even responded to a critical post from Mr Trump by saying: &quot;Why don&#x27;t you send everyone proof of life first?&quot; His post was retweeted more than 6,000 times.</p><p>Mr Trump used his own platform, Truth Social, to insist he had &quot;NEVER FELT BETTER IN MY LIFE&quot; on Sunday evening, local time.</p><p>On Tuesday, he said he knew people had been speculating about his health.</p><p>But after a Fox News reporter asked him: &quot;How did you find out over the weekend that you were dead?&quot; Mr Trump said he &quot;didn&#x27;t hear it to that extent&quot;.</p><p>&quot;I have heard. It&#x27;s sort of crazy, but last week I did numerous news conferences, all successful,&quot; Mr Trump said.</p><p>&quot;And then I didn&#x27;t do any for two days and they said, &#x27;There must be something wrong with him.&#x27;</p><p>&quot;[Former US president Joe] Biden wouldn&#x27;t do them for months, you wouldn&#x27;t see him, and nobody ever said there was ever anything wrong with him.&quot;</p><p>Mr Trump held the press conference to announce a plan to move the headquarters for the US&#x27;s outer-space military force, Space Command, from Colorado to Alabama. He was not asked any further questions about his health. </p><p>In July, the White House said he had been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), a condition where weakened veins in a person&#x27;s legs are unable to effectively pump blood back to the heart.</p><p>The condition is not considered a serious health threat, but can cause pain, swelling, skin changes and varicose veins.</p></div>]]></content:encoded>

          </figure><div><p>With the faint sting of tear gas adding to Jakarta&#x27;s already thick air, a densely packed crowd of young Indonesians is steadily multiplying.</p><p>They&#x27;re carrying the tools of civilian resistance — flags, fireworks, bottles and of course, their phones.</p><p>Many have toothpaste smeared under their eyes, in a desperate bid to counter the effects of tear gas.</p><p>Indonesia&#x27;s Marines and Air Force personnel, who are well respected in the country, are keeping the crowd from their target: the Jakarta headquarters of Indonesia&#x27;s tactical police squad, BRIMOB.</p><p>In front of the building are officers from the paramilitary unit, standing armed with riot shields.</p><p>The crowd swells, eagerly chanting for the defence forces to let them through.</p><p>Moments later, they get their wish.</p><p>Thousands of students and young workers surge forward, shooting fireworks and throwing bottles and Molotov cocktails at police.</p><p>As expected, they&#x27;re met with tear gas, forcing them to race back and try again to reach the police line.</p><p>These are the kinds of scenes that have played out for days in Jakarta&#x27;s streets, with young people and many other Indonesians from all walks of life, demonstrating their furious anger at the government and police.</p><h4>How a protest over allowances turned into a riot</h4><p>Demonstrations began on Monday last week, with <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-09-02/indonesian-mps-houses-looted-amid-jakarta-protests-over-perks/105722932">people taking to the streets</a> to voice their anger over a housing allowance and other perks paid to members of parliament that many in the country felt were lavish at a time of budget cuts.</p><p>These protests, mostly involving students, young Indonesians and labour groups, became a forum to raise their anger at the government&#x27;s management of the economy and Indonesia&#x27;s extreme income inequality.</p><p>Millions of young people across the country are unemployed and millions of Indonesians remain in poverty.</p><p>President Prabowo Subianto has slashed the government budget to fund his ambitious spending promises, including the free school lunch program for primary school students.</p><p>The austerity measures are impacting many and fuelling considerable anger.</p><p>While protests in Indonesia are known for occasional clashes between police and protesters, the actions of police on Thursday night caused everything to change.</p><p>Members from Indonesia&#x27;s police paramilitary, BRIMOB, drove at protesters in an armoured vehicle, causing mass panic.</p><p>A video that has gone viral online shows hundreds of protesters fleeing as the vehicle hit and killed ride-share motorcycle driver Affan Kurniawan.</p><p>His death united various groups sharing long-standing anger at Indonesia&#x27;s police, and <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-08-30/indonesia-protests-spread-as-anger-grows-over-taxi-rider-death/105715278">escalated protests into furious unrest that spread across the whole country</a>.</p><p>In the last few days, provincial government buildings have been torched, <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-08-30/three-dead-after-mob-sets-fire-to-indonesia-regional-parliament/105716624">killing at least three people</a> in South Sulawesi.</p><p>The houses of MPs who had made inflammatory comments were <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-09-02/indonesian-mps-houses-looted-amid-jakarta-protests-over-perks/105722932">raided and looted</a>, with footage spreading quickly over social media.</p><p>Civil society groups say at least 10 people have been killed, including one teenager.</p><p>Desperately trying to calm things down, President Subianto cancelled a trip to China and tried to reassure the public an investigation into the police responsible for Mr Kurniawan&#x27;s death would be handled quickly.</p><p>He also said <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-08-31/indonesia-president-revokes-number-of-perks-for-politicians/105718254">controversial entitlements and perks would be wound back</a>.</p><p>There&#x27;s now an enormous police and military presence in Jakarta, scaring off many protesters in recent days.</p><h4>Who is involved?</h4><p>At protests and demonstrations, there have been mixes of different groups in Indonesia, including university students, high-schoolers, ride-share and delivery drivers, and out-of-work, struggling young people.</p><p>Sandi Indriawan, a young worker from the outskirts of Jakarta, told the ABC he had travelled to the protest at BRIMOB&#x27;s Jakarta HQ to raise his frustrations about the government.</p><p>&quot;We just want the parliament to create laws that make life easier for us,&quot; he said.</p><blockquote><p>&quot;I feel hopeless for this country. We are all on the street right now to voice our concerns to the people at the top.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Angger Sifa, 29, said he was furious at Indonesia&#x27;s inequality, along with choices the government was making.</p><p>&quot;This month, the price of rice increased, our tax increased, to increase the income of parliament members,&quot; he said.</p><p>&quot;We&#x27;re here protesting from one morning til the next morning, because we&#x27;re angry.&quot;</p><p>University students, who have held an important role in protests in Indonesia&#x27;s history, have been one of the most vocal groups calling for change.</p><p>Sri Meisista, Chair of the Islamic Women Student Association, said she felt Indonesia&#x27;s democracy was unstable.</p><p>&quot;Education sectors, like the incentive for the teachers, was hit bad by the government&#x27;s efficiency policy, while their allowances were being raised,&quot; she said.</p><p>&quot;It&#x27;s hurt us as a student seeing the MPs dancing happily above us, while we suffer.&quot;</p><p>&quot;We saw their high lifestyles revealed, and that&#x27;s materialised in public anger all over Indonesia.&quot;</p><p>Information about protests was widely shared on social media platforms like TikTok, with clashes beamed to phone screens across the country and globally, partially becoming a tool for information sharing and organisation.</p><p>But late on Saturday, TikTok suspended its live-streaming feature, cutting off a crucial online source for many young people to keep up with the protests or share what was unfolding.</p><p>Earlier last week, Reuters reported that Indonesia&#x27;s government had summoned representatives from TikTok, which is owned by China&#x27;s ByteDance, and told them to boost content moderation because of misinformation.</p><p>That move has been heavily criticised, with many fearful that it was suppressing free speech.</p><p>There have also been allegations that some protesters were paid to take part, with rival political factions potentially factoring into last week&#x27;s protests.</p><p>&quot;There is an existing political conflict among political elites, even between President Prabowo and former President Joko Widodo,&quot; Amnesty International Indonesia Director Usman Hamid said.</p><p>&quot;But I don&#x27;t believe everything started from that conflict, I think it comes from government ignorance, unfair policies on tax, spending cuts, on allowances for parliament that aren&#x27;t sensitive,&quot; he said.</p><h4>President warns of &#x27;treason&#x27;</h4><p>Protests on the streets of Jakarta quietened on Monday following Prabowo&#x27;s speech, after he warned protesters and told police and Indonesia&#x27;s military to take firm action.</p><p>There has been a large surge in the visibility of both military and police personnel on the streets of the capital.</p><p>The former military general walked a fine line when talking about protesters on Sunday.</p><p>On one hand, he said the &quot;genuine aspirations&quot; of the public needed to be respected.</p><p>On the other, he called the actions of some &quot;crossing into treason and terrorism.&quot;</p><p>He&#x27;s also promoted police officers who have been injured in the riots.</p><blockquote><p>&quot;It&#x27;s dangerous for the head of the government to label peaceful protesters as anarchists, terrorists and treasonous,&quot; Mr Hamid said.</p></blockquote><p>&quot;I think these labels will make things worse.</p><p>&quot;They&#x27;re intended to justify police brutality and military violence across Indonesia.</p><p>&quot;I don&#x27;t think in the next couple of weeks there will be a resolution, or a restoration of order in Indonesia, especially in urban areas where the protests are taking place.&quot;</p></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>North Korea would not exist if it weren&#x27;t for China.</p><p>During the Korean War, North Korean forces were on the back foot after the United States launched one of the most stunning and successful counteroffensives in wartime history.</p><p>Defeat looked certain.</p><p>But China came to the rescue, sending waves and waves of troops to overwhelm the South Korean allies.</p><p>It led to an eventual stalemate at the 38th parallel, where modern-day borders remain drawn.</p><p>In the decades after, North Korea relied on China for its own protection, while China enjoyed the buffer the regime created between it and the US-allied South.</p><p>North Korea&#x27;s isolation from the world, in some ways, benefited China, and it relied almost entirely on Beijing for trade.</p><p>But in recent years, the relationship between the two has been overshadowed by North Korea&#x27;s relationship with Russia.</p><p>The pair have become such prominent allies that thousands of North Korean troops have been sent to fight and die in Ukraine.</p><p>Today, the leaders of China, North Korea and Russia — Xi Jinping, Kim Jong Un and Vladimir Putin — will send a powerful message to the world <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-09-02/leaders-convene-in-china-for-security-summit/105725362">as they stand side by side, watching a grand military parade in Tiananmen Square.</a></p><p>The occasion marks 80 years since the defeat of Japan in World War II.</p><p>But it will also project a powerful unified bloc of authoritarian regimes.</p><p>And China will be keen to send another message — that it is the centre of this bloc.</p><h4>Russia turns to North Korea</h4><p>Kim rarely leaves North Korea.</p><p>This is the first time the North Korean leader has been to China in six years. Two of those years were the pandemic, so no-one was travelling much.</p><p>But since then, North Korea has been far more openly engaged with Russia.</p><p>In 2023, Kim took his heavily armoured train to Russia for a high-level visit, and a year later, Putin returned the favour, witnessing a highly choreographed military parade in Pyongyang.</p><p>The two leaders signed a new military alliance.</p><p>North Korea has since provided Russia with thousands of troops to assist its invasion of Ukraine.</p><p>In return, Russia is meant to be helping advance North Korean military technology, something it&#x27;s long struggled with.</p><p>Authoritarian regimes rarely share such sensitive tech.</p><p>Russia and China have long refused to give the North Koreans anything too useful, preferring to keep the unruly regime in check.</p><p>But Russia&#x27;s quagmire in Ukraine left it with little choice.</p><p>It embraced its international pariah status and joined forces with North Korea, one of the cruellest and most isolationist regimes.</p><p>Institute for National Security Strategy senior research fellow Go Myong-Hyun described the relationship as &quot;transactional.&quot;</p><p>&quot;The Russians are in a bind,&quot; Dr Go said.</p><p>&quot;They&#x27;re not doing too well in Ukraine, so they need all the help they can get.&quot;</p><p>He said this pressured Russia to share sensitive technology with North Korea. But that could end if the war in Ukraine stops.</p><h4>China, North Korea need each other</h4><p>China has held a more cautious stance.</p><p>It&#x27;s needed North Korea as a buffer but views Pyongyang&#x27;s nuclear program and belligerence as an unwelcome source of regional instability.</p><p>China has also tried a more neutral stance with Ukraine, as it cannot afford to abandon its economic relationship with the West.</p><p>It also has a healthy trade relationship with South Korea, North Korea&#x27;s archenemy.</p><p>The lack of big showy announcements between Beijing and Pyongyang recently has led some to speculate the relationship has been sidelined.</p><p>Dongkuk University professor Kim Yong Hyun said there may be &quot;some feelings of neglect&quot;.</p><p>&quot;There haven&#x27;t really been any notable diplomatic or economic events between the two, so from that angle, one could say there is a certain sense of disappointment in the relationship,&quot; he said.</p><p>But Professor Kim stressed the relationship fundamentally had not changed.</p><p>The two still need each other — and that won&#x27;t change.</p><p>&quot;From Pyongyang&#x27;s perspective, this visit is meaningful as a way to reconfirm economic, diplomatic, and even military cooperation with China,&quot; he said.</p><p>&quot;For China as well, this visit serves to showcase the strength of the China–North Korea relationship, dispelling any perception that ties have weakened as North Korea–Russia relations have grown stronger.&quot;</p><h4>Meetings in Beijing about &#x27;optics&#x27;</h4><p>Perhaps the most important audience for today&#x27;s spectacle is US President Donald Trump.</p><p>He&#x27;s talked up his good relations with all three leaders, at times even heaping praise on them.</p><p>After meeting with Putin in August, Trump then announced he was keen to meet with North Korea&#x27;s leader.</p><p>The pair tried to strike a deal during Trump&#x27;s last presidency, but it spectacularly fell flat.</p><p>A second attempt to strike a deal may occur as soon as this year.</p><p>For now, the eyes are on the leaders of China, Russia and North Korea.</p><p>Bilateral meetings are expected, but it is unclear if the trio will hold a trilateral meeting.</p><p>Go Myong-Hyun doesn&#x27;t expect any big announcements.</p><p>China still needs to balance its interests with Russia, North Korea and the West.</p><p>But the powerful symbolism of the three attending a big military parade is enough.</p><p>And it was China&#x27;s gravitational pull that brought them together.</p><p>&quot;[China] wants to send a message to the Americans … that it still is the leader of this bloc,&quot; Dr Go said.</p><p>&quot;It&#x27;s really about the view, the optics, rather than the substance.&quot;</p></div>]]></content:encoded>

Indrika Ratwatte, the UN&#x27;s resident coordinator for Afghanistan, told a media briefing on Tuesday.</p><p>He urged the international community to step forward.</p><blockquote><p>&quot;These are life and death decisions while we race against time to reach people.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Rescue efforts are focused on the eastern provinces of Kunar and Nangarhar, where the earthquake hit the hardest.</p><p>Gul Bibi, an 80-year-old, was weeping, holding a toddler in her arms, next to a destroyed house in the mountain village of Mazar Dara, one of the places worst hit in Kunar province.</p><p>&quot;I lost everything,&quot; Bibi said, saying her family was buried under the mud and debris of their home.</p><p>&quot;Just this grandson survived.&quot;</p><p>In Dara-e-Noor, in the province of Nangarhar, 23-year-old Ziarat Gul said his uncle’s house collapsed, killing a seven-year-old boy and two girls.</p><p>&quot;We pulled them out with our hands, but they were already gone.&quot; </p><p>He and his family have been sleeping in open fields since the quake.</p><p>Ehsanullah Ehsan, the provincial head of disaster management, said efforts would now move to helping those in more remote villages.</p><p>&quot;We cannot accurately predict how many bodies might still be trapped under the rubble,&quot; Mr Ehsan said.</p><p>&quot;Our effort is to complete these operations as soon as possible and to begin distributing aid to the affected families.&quot;</p><p>Mountainous terrain and inclement weather have hindered rescuers reaching remote areas along the Pakistani border where the quake flattened hundreds of mud-and-brick homes.</p><p>Access for vehicles along narrow mountain roads was the main obstacle, he said, adding machinery was being brought in to clear roads of debris.</p><p>On Tuesday, a line of ambulances was on the damaged mountain road trying to reach Kunar villages as helicopters flew in, bringing aid supplies and taking the injured to hospitals, according to a Reuters witness.</p><p>Some of those injured have been transferred to hospitals in Kabul and the adjacent province of Nangarhar.</p><h4>Aid slow to arrive</h4><p>The UN warned on Tuesday that thousands of children were particularly vulnerable following the disaster, with UNICEF sending medicine, clothing, tents, hygiene and sanitary items as well as towels and water buckets.</p><p>Local authorities said many people were living in the open after having their houses destroyed.</p><p>The rescue and relief work has struggled in the face of tight resources in the war-torn, impoverished nation of 42 million people and limited global help in the aftermath of the tragedy.</p><p>Britain has allocated £1 million ($2.56m) to support aid efforts provided by the UN and International Red Cross.</p><p>Other nations such as China, the United Arab Emirates, the European Union, Pakistan and Iran have pledged help but aid is yet to arrive.</p><p>India delivered 1,000 tents and was sending 15 tonnes of food to Kunar, with further relief expected to be sent on Tuesday.</p><p>Afghanistan has been badly hit by US President Donald Trump&#x27;s decision to cut funding to its humanitarian arm USAID and reductions in other foreign aid programs.</p><p>Crises elsewhere in the world, along with donor frustration over the Taliban&#x27;s policies toward women and curbs on aid workers, have been a factor in funding cuts, according to diplomats and aid officials.</p><p><strong>ABC/wires</strong></p></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping have met for informal talks on the sidelines of a string of diplomatic events in China.</p><p>More than 20 world leaders convened in Tianjin in northern China at the weekend for the annual Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit, ahead of an extravagant military parade commemorating the end of World War II that will take place this Wednesday.</p><p>Mr Xi and Mr Putin have used the security forum, which was originally established as a counter-balance to US influence in Asia, to pitch establishing a &quot;new, more effective&quot; world order.</p><p>Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico and Serbia&#x27;s Aleksandar Vucic, who are both critical of sanctions on Russia over its war in Ukraine, were the only Western leaders in attendance.</p><p>Meanwhile, North Korean leader Kim Yong Un has travelled to China on board an armoured train, for what will be his first visit to Beijing since 2019.</p><p>Here is how the week of diplomacy has unfolded so far.</p><h4>High tea for high-stakes relationship</h4><p>Mr Putin and Mr Xi sat opposite each other at a table adorned with delicate cakes and petit fours, having a tea break after an hour of diplomatic talks.</p><p>Their highly anticipated bilateral meeting did not deliver any big surprises, but was hugely important for Mr Putin&#x27;s image, after being ostracised from the global stage because of Russia&#x27;s war in Ukraine.</p><p>&quot;Both I and the entire Russian delegation are pleased to meet once again with our Chinese friends and colleagues,&quot; Mr Putin said of the man he has previously called his best friend, according to a video published by the Kremlin on social media.</p><p>&quot;Our close communication reflects the strategic nature of Russia-China relations, which are at an unprecedentedly high level.&quot;</p><p>China is Russia&#x27;s largest trading partner and Moscow is heavily reliant on Beijing to prop up its economy, which has been crippled by US sanctions.</p><p>Mr Xi used the bilateral meeting to further cement his ambitions for promoting a new world order.</p><blockquote><p>&quot;China is willing to work together with Russia to support each other&#x27;s national development and revitalisation, firmly uphold fairness and justice, and promote the building of a more just and equitable global governance order,&quot; he said.</p></blockquote><p>Behind the scenes, it is expected the two have discussed the war in Ukraine, which China has previously offered to act as a peace-broker for, and Mr Putin has supported.</p><h4>A show of friendship</h4><p>At an exhibition centre in Tianjin on Monday morning, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi beamed as he marched to greet Mr Xi in a busy hall.</p><p>Mr Modi was due to <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-09-01/narendra-modi-meets-putin-at-shanghai-cooperation-meeting/105722964">sit down with Mr Putin</a>, and by all appearances, he was expecting it to go well.</p><p>So much so, the two leaders were holding hands as they entered the room.</p><p>The subtle gesture of solidarity came just days after the US doubled its tariff on Indian goods to 50 per cent for buying Russian oil.</p><p>In a video released by the Kremlin, Mr Putin described his Indian counterpart as a &quot;dear friend&quot;, underlining the jovial mood at the talks.</p><p>Later, Mr Modi posted a picture on X of him and Mr Putin inside the armoured Aurus limousine used by the Russian leader.</p><p>Mr Putin often travels with the Aurus on foreign trips and has occasionally offered rides to fellow leaders, or even gifted the vehicle, as he did to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in 2024.</p><p>Russian state media reported that before the formal dialogue, the two leaders spoke one on one for almost an hour in the vehicle.</p><h4>Soft power shapes talks</h4><p>Bringing together leaders from across Asia and Europe, Mr Xi saw the week as an opportunity to present as a foil to US President Donald Trump&#x27;s aggressive diplomacy and economic tariffs.</p><p>He used his speech at the talks on Monday to promote Chinese leadership, and called out the &quot;bullying behaviour&quot; and &quot;cold war mentality&quot; of other countries.</p><p>&quot;We must continue to take a clear stand against hegemonism and power politics, and practice true multilateralism,&quot; Mr Xi said.</p><p>&quot;Global governance has reached a new crossroads.&quot;</p><p>He and Mr Putin pitched their vision for a new global security and economic order, in a direct challenge to the US, often highlighting the close nature of their relationships with the nations present.</p><p>National University of Singapore Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy professor Alfred Wu said Mr Xi was seeking &quot;to provide an alternate world order&quot; because the US-led world order was &quot;very much in decline&quot;.</p><p>Mr Putin echoed those themes in his own address and expressed support for Mr Xi&#x27;s proposal &quot;to create a new, more effective and functional system of global governance.&quot;</p><p>Mr Xi called for the creation of a new development bank, in what would be a major step towards the bloc&#x27;s long-held aspiration of developing an alternative payment system that circumvents the US dollar and the power of US sanctions.</p><p>Their meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is the next set piece.</p><h4>Kim Jong Un&#x27;s first multilateral event</h4><p>A bottle green train crossed the border into China early Tuesday.</p><p>In one of its many armoured carriages was the reclusive Mr Kim.</p><p>Compared with North Korea&#x27;s aging fleet of aircraft, the train offered Kim a slower but safer journey abroad.</p><p>Trains have traditionally been at the centre of state propaganda around the Kim family, often used to meet ordinary North Koreans around the country and relied on for trips overseas.</p><p>For Mr Kim, this week is no different.</p><p>A photo taken inside shows Mr Kim grinning at a desk, accompanied by members of his entourage.</p><p>A gold-embossed laptop, his signature pack of cigarettes and bottles of liquid adorn the tabletop in front of him.</p><p>To his side, a bank of landline telephones is laid out against windows trimmed with blue and gold curtains.</p><p>This week is a major milestone for Mr Kim&#x27;s diplomatic credentials, being his first major multilateral event, and the first time a North Korean leader has attended a Chinese military parade in 66 years.</p><p>North Korea expressed support for Mr Xi&#x27;s remarks calling for fairer global governance on Monday, adding that cooperation between North Korea and China would grow to pursue such a value, according to a vice foreign minister in comments posted on the North Korean foreign ministry&#x27;s website.</p><p>Mr Kim&#x27;s presence this week has raised the prospect of a new trilateral defence axis between China, Russia and North Korea that could change the military calculus in the Asia-Pacific region.</p><p>&quot;The presence of Vladimir Putin, [Iran&#x27;s] Masoud Pezeshkian, and Kim Jong Un underscores China&#x27;s role as the world&#x27;s leading authoritarian power,&quot; said Neil Thomas, a Chinese politics expert at the Asia Society Policy Institute&#x27;s Center for China Analysis.</p><p>The increase in leaders from Central Asian, West Asian and Southeast Asian countries attending this year&#x27;s parade compared to the last one in 2015 highlighted Beijing&#x27;s progress in regional diplomacy, Mr Thomas added.</p><p><strong>ABC/AP/Reuters</strong></p></div>]]></content:encoded>

          </figure><div><p>It&#x27;s a weeknight in Washington DC and soldiers with assault rifles are pacing through the national parks while federal agents are spotted on a popular nightlife strip.</p><p>They are patrolling the capital under President Donald Trump&#x27;s orders, but they are also being closely monitored themselves.</p><p>Local activists are texting on encrypted messaging apps and scouting streets to find law enforcement with the intention of documenting, recording and posting their activities online.</p><p>In two vehicles are Elli, Cap, Gizmo and Brit — aliases for this motley crew who make it well known that they do not want these federal agents here.</p><p>Elli has been out with their phone filming federal agents every night since Mr Trump announced his crime crackdown.</p><p>The 19-year-old&#x27;s sleep schedule is all over the place as they also work in a nearby bar.</p><p>&quot;I intend to keep doing this until these feds leave or I end up in handcuffs — whichever one comes first,&quot; they told the ABC.</p><p>&quot;Am I afraid? Yes. But that doesn&#x27;t mean that I&#x27;m intimidated into stopping, into being silent.&quot;</p><h4>Community concerns about federal crackdown</h4><p>Three weeks ago, <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-08-12/donald-trump-washington-dc-crime-national-guard-federal-takeover/105640322">the US president declared there was an &quot;epidemic of crime&quot; in Washington, and announced the federal government was seizing control of the city&#x27;s police department.</a></p><p>Hundreds of officers and agents from over a dozen federal agencies were sent out across the city, as well as hundreds of troops from the National Guard.</p><p>At the time, Mr Trump called it a historic action to &quot;rescue our nation&#x27;s capital from crime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor and worse&quot;.</p><p>Democratic Mayor Muriel Bowser initially pushed back on Mr Trump&#x27;s claims, saying DC was &quot;not experiencing a crime spike&quot; and called his announcement &quot;unsettling and unprecedented&quot;.</p><p>But the mayor has since spoken positively of the federal intervention, acknowledging there have been reductions in crime, including an &quot;87 per cent reduction in carjackings&quot;.</p><p>&quot;We greatly appreciate the surge of officers that enhance what MPD (Metropolitan Police Department) has been able to do in this city,&quot; she said.</p><p>Violent crime has dropped even further, Ms Bowser said, and some residents are happy with the results.</p><p>By the end of August, there had been 1,599 arrests made and 165 illegal guns seized in Washington, according to US Attorney-General Pam Bondi.</p><p>Many of these arrests included low-level offences such as possession of drugs, having an open container of alcohol, and traffic violations.</p><p>It was also unclear how many people arrested were later charged with a crime.</p><p>But not everyone has been happy with the crackdown.</p><p>Reverend George Gilbert Jr, who lives in a lower socio-economic neighbourhood in DC, said his community felt like it was being targeted.</p><p>&quot;They&#x27;re going into public housing units where people live and they are basically doing stop and frisk,&quot; he said.</p><p>&quot;They&#x27;re just fishing to see if they can find something or someone that they can harass and arrest.</p><p>&quot;There are checkpoints across the city where cars are being stopped for no real reason. We are literally a city under siege.&quot;</p><p>And Elli said they had witnessed &quot;egregious&quot; violations of due process from authorities arresting or detaining individuals over the past few weeks.</p><h4>The activist network patrolling the streets</h4><p>On a night accompanied by the ABC, Elli and the crew stumbled across a large local police presence after reports of a fight having broken out between two men at a petrol station.</p><p>Dozens of officers were at the scene as locals honked, rode by and pulled out their phones to film.</p><p>The scene was tense. People were shouting at the police while Elli and Cap asked the men involved for their phone numbers, names and if there was anyone they wanted them to call.</p><p>&quot;We want to make sure that even if a crime was committed — which we don&#x27;t know in this case — that we&#x27;re able to know where everybody is, where they&#x27;re being booked and then if there&#x27;s a family member that they need someone to call for them to meet them at the precinct,&quot; Elli said.</p><p>One police officer repeated to the growing crowd, &quot;I don&#x27;t mind you recording&quot;, but asked people to step back.</p><p>One man was arrested while the other man involved in the incident was released.</p><p>&quot;Initially, our concern is brutality; we wanted to make sure that they were treating him with respect,&quot; Elli said.</p><p>&quot;We&#x27;re here to just make sure that everything is being done according to procedure, and so far, it seems like it has, and that could be because we are here.&quot;</p><p>Elli said law enforcement had a legitimate place within society, but they were concerned about the surge of federal agents and the disproportionate number of law enforcement officers in DC.</p><p>Each night they said they were also &quot;backroom documenting&quot;, which included taking photos of licence plates, agents&#x27; faces, badges and behaviours.</p><p>&quot;We&#x27;re in the process of trying to build a system where we can sort of collate the different vehicles and agents that are prowling the city … so we can put out calls for folks to either document them when they see them in public or just stay away from them,&quot; Elli said.</p><p>&quot;I have an obligation as a community member and also as a person of faith to witness and to bear witness to what&#x27;s going on, if nothing else.&quot;</p><p>In particular, they were concerned for the wellbeing of immigrants who are being targeted, detained and deported by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).</p><h4>ICE agents targeting communal places, locals say</h4><p>Agents from ICE have been seen throughout the city raiding buildings and detaining individuals.</p><p>The Department of Homeland Security&#x27;s Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told Fox they were targeting the &quot;worst of the worst — including gang members, murderers, paedophiles, terrorists and rapists&quot;.</p><p>The DHS has released details surrounding some of those immigrants caught to support its case in a city where residents have come out in numbers to protest ICE&#x27;s presence.</p><p>There have also been reports of agents targeting places of worship and schools to detain immigrants.</p><p>In several instances, the ABC has been told these individuals had done nothing wrong apart from entering the country illegally decades ago.</p><p>One pastor from a church in a community with a large Latino population said members of his congregation had gone missing and he had to cancel a Sunday service because &quot;10 ICE vehicles were parked out back waiting&quot; for it to start.</p><p>He did not want to be identified due to concerns that his church would be targeted further.</p><p>A worker at a nearby religious organisation told the ABC that two parents who were dropping their children off at the associated school were taken away by ICE agents waiting for them. Their kids were left at the school without their mum and dad.</p><p>&quot;All the other students were crying, people are very scared right now,&quot; she said.</p><h4>Religious leaders urge ICE to stay out of church</h4><p>Nearly two dozen religious leaders across DC signed a letter urging federal immigration officials to stay off church property, as agents had been using parking lots as staging areas throughout the week.</p><p>As part of this surge, Mr Trump also said he was going to get rid of the &quot;slums&quot; of homeless people in the city.</p><p>He has reposted a video on social media of tents being dismantled and removed from sidewalks.</p><p>Some churches have seen a drop in people experiencing homelessness using their services and food programs.</p><p>Reverend Gilbert, who has lived in the capital his entire life, said what he was witnessing in his hometown went against the principles of his faith.</p><p>&quot;What we are saying to the White House is that the acts that they are doing throughout Washington DC are not acts of love and have nothing to do with Christianity,&quot; he said.</p><p>&quot;They call themselves Christian nationals, where the truth is they&#x27;re putting their country before their God.</p><p>&quot;There is nowhere in the Bible, in any translation, where you don&#x27;t look after the poor, you don&#x27;t look after the least, the lost and the left out.&quot;</p><h4>DC council member wants more protests</h4><p>While Mayor Bowser has been happy with the sharp drop in crime, she has not approved of other elements of the crackdown.</p><p>&quot;We know having masked ICE agents in the community has not worked in National Guard from other states, has not been an efficient use of those resources,&quot; she said.</p><p>Overall, Ms Bowser has been praised by the president for her collaboration. He has lambasted other Democratic mayors who have threatened a more obstructive approach should he send the National Guard and other agencies into their cities.</p><p>Within the DC council, though, others wanted residents to keep fighting back.</p><p>There have been protests weekly across the city with thousands turning up and marching in opposition to the law enforcement &quot;takeover&quot;.</p><p>Council member Zachary Parker held a town hall with his ward&#x27;s residents about how to protest more effectively.</p><p>&quot;We need more of it,&quot; he said.</p><p>&quot;I&#x27;m trying to effectively channel that frustration in order to mobilise neighbours so we can push back effectively on what&#x27;s happening in our city.&quot;</p><p>Some Republican states have sent their National Guard to DC to assist in the crackdown.</p><p>&quot;I find it rich that red states have sent their National Guard … when some of those states have cities that have worse crime than the nation&#x27;s capital,&quot; Mr Parker said.</p><p>&quot;I think it&#x27;s a fool&#x27;s errand to frame this around crime. We will never win that debate because crime is a self-fulfilling prophecy — any crime is too much.</p><blockquote><p>&quot;As much as we debate and justify whether or not there is a crime issue in DC, it misses the broader point.</p></blockquote><p>&quot;This is about power and control and the dangerous tactics that this administration is employing to disrupt our local autonomy, and I would argue disrupt democracy, here in the country.&quot;</p></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>A leading group of genocide scholars has declared Israel is committing genocide in Gaza.</p><p>The International Association of Genocide Scholars (IAGS), chaired by University of Western Australia international law professor Melanie O&#x27;Brien, passed a resolution finding &quot;Israel&#x27;s policies and actions in Gaza meet the legal definition of genocide in Article II of the United Nations Convention for the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (1948)&quot;.</p><p>The association also found Israel was committing crimes against humanity in Gaza.</p><p>The association said a majority of its voting members supported the resolution, which called on Israel to &quot;immediately cease all acts that constitute genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity against Palestinians in Gaza, including deliberate attacks against and killing of civilians including children; starvation; deprivation of humanitarian aid, water, fuel, and other items essential to the survival of the population; sexual and reproductive violence; and forced displacement of the population&quot;.</p><p>Of the association&#x27;s 500 members, 28 per cent took part in the vote. Of those, 86 per cent voted in favour of the resolution. </p><p>It also calls on states, which have signed the genocide convention, such as Australia, to ensure they are meeting their obligations in terms of preventing arms sales to Israel and upholding international law.</p><p>Israel has repeatedly denied it is committing genocide in Gaza and it is fighting a case brought by South Africa in the International Court of Justice (ICJ) alleging that its actions in Gaza amount to genocide.</p><p>The IAGS said Israel must comply with the provisional measures already ordered by the ICJ, such as allowing adequate food, water, shelter and medicine.</p><p>It said Israel&#x27;s actions in Gaza included multiple crimes and actions that indicate an intent to destroy the Palestinian people in whole or in part.</p><p>&quot;The actions of the Israeli government against Palestinians have included torture, arbitrary detention, and sexual and reproductive violence; deliberate attacks on medical professionals, humanitarian aid workers and journalists; and the deliberate deprivation of food, water, medicine, and electricity essential to the survival of the population,&quot; the resolution said.</p><h4>Israel says findings &#x27;an embarrassment&#x27;</h4><p>Some actions — such as killing children and destroying schools, libraries and cultural sites — appeared designed to erase Palestinian identity and eliminate the next generation of Palestinians, the group said.</p><p>The IAGS resolution also noted that Hamas and other Palestinian groups that participated in the October 7 attacks committed serious crimes in breach of international law.</p><p>Major human rights organisations, <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-07-29/israeli-orgs-label-gaza-situation-genocide/105584184">including Israel&#x27;s two leading human rights groups</a>, have already declared Israel&#x27;s actions in Gaza constitute genocide.</p><p>Israel maintains that its actions in Gaza are in self-defence and targeted at the militant group Hamas.</p><p>In response to the ABC, Israel&#x27;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs labelled the IAGS resolution &quot;an embarrassment to the legal profession and to any academic standard&quot;.</p><p>&quot;It is entirely based on Hamas&#x27;s campaign of lies and the laundering of those lies by others. The IAGS did not do the most basic task in research, which is to verify the information. It even manages to misrepresent what the ICJ has said,&quot; it said.</p><p>&quot;Above all, the IAGS has set a historic precedent — for the first time, &#x27;Genocide Scholars&#x27; accuse the very victim of genocide — despite Hamas&#x27;s attempted genocide against the Jewish people, murdering 1,200 people, raping women, burning families alive, and declaring its goal of killing every Jew.&quot;</p><p>Professor O&#x27;Brien has rejected Israel&#x27;s self-defence stance, saying: &quot;That justification has really gone out the window.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I can definitively say that there is no justification for the commission of war crimes, crimes against humanity, or genocide, not even self-defence,&quot; she said.</p><p>&quot;When we talk about the concept of self-defence in international law, we still have to apply aspects of international law. There isn&#x27;t just a blanket right to self-defence.</p><p>&quot;That self-defence has to be carried out in a proportionate manner and it also has to be shown to be something carried out from military necessity, neither of which are demonstrated anymore by Israel&#x27;s actions on the ground in Gaza.&quot;</p><p>Hamas released a statement saying the IAGS resolution &quot;constitutes a new legal documentation, added to the international reports and testimonies that have documented the genocide our people are enduring in full view of the world&quot;.</p><p>Previously, Israel&#x27;s government has said <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-01-12/israel-rejects-claims-of-genocide-levelled-in-world-court/103315994">genocide allegations are politicised</a> and intended to prevent the state defending itself.</p><p>&quot;The goal is not justice. Israel&#x27;s enemies weaponise international legal institutions to try and render Israel defenceless,&quot; Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said on April 28.</p><p>Israel has called South Africa&#x27;s case against it in the International Court of Justice &quot;wholly unfounded in fact and law, [and] morally repugnant&quot;, saying it &quot;represents an abuse both of the Genocide Convention and of the court itself&quot;.</p><h4>&#x27;Merciless night in Gaza City&#x27;</h4><p>Air strikes and artillery shelling have echoed through Gaza City since Israel declared it a combat zone last week.</p><p>It comes ahead of a planned Israeli military operation to occupy the city, which has drawn international condemnation and protests within Israel.</p><p>On Gaza City&#x27;s outskirts and in the Jabaliya refugee camp, residents have observed explosive-laden robots demolishing buildings.</p><p>&quot;Another merciless night in Gaza City,&quot; said Saeed Abu Elaish, a Jabaliya-born medic sheltering in the north-western side of the city.</p><p>Hospitals in Gaza said at least 31 people were killed by Israeli fire on Monday, more than half of them women and children.</p><p>At least 13 people of those killed were in Gaza City, where Israel has carried out several previous large-scale raids since Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel to ignite the war on October 7, 2023.</p><p>Israel says it only targets militants and blames Hamas for civilian casualties because the militant group — now largely reduced to a guerrilla organisation — operates in densely populated areas.</p><p>The war between Hamas and Israel was sparked when the militant group entered Israel in October 2023, killing 1,200 people and taking a further 251 hostage.</p><p>A total of 63,557 Palestinians have been killed in the war, according to Gaza&#x27;s Health Ministry, which says another 160,660 people have been wounded.</p><p>The ministry does not differentiate between civilians and combatants in its count, but says women and children make up around half the dead.</p><p><strong>ABC/wires</strong></p><p><em><strong>Editor&#x27;s note 02/09/2025: An earlier version of this story said &quot;the association said 86 per cent of its 500 members voted in favour of the resolution&quot;. This has been updated to clarify that it was 86 per cent of voting members who supported the resolution, not 86 per cent of all 500 members.</strong></em></p></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>Russia is suspected to have &quot;neutralised&quot; the GPS systems of a plane carrying European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in Bulgaria.</p><p>The GPS jamming attack forced the Dassault Falcon 900LX plane to land using &quot;terrestrial navigation tools&quot; like paper maps and a compass on Monday local time, according to Bulgarian officials.</p><p>EU commission spokesperson Arianna Podestà said the <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-09-01/eu-president-plane-gps-intercepted-by-russian-interference/105722818">jamming incident was suspected to be &quot;blatant interference by Russia&quot;.</a></p><p>When asked about the allegations, a Kremlin spokesperson told the Financial Times, &quot;Your information is incorrect.&quot;</p><p>The incident with Ms von der Leyen&#x27;s plane joins a growing list of alleged acts of Russian interference with GPS satellite navigation.</p><p>Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia and other countries bordering Russia have warned of increased electronic activity interfering with flights, ships and drones.</p><p>Australian National University Centre of European Studies visiting fellow Matthew Sussex said Russia was &quot;normally behind these types of GPS jamming attacks in Europe.&quot;</p><p>Professor Sussex said the attack aimed at the chief of the EU was &quot;an escalation&quot; in Russia&#x27;s hybrid warfare.</p><p>Ms von der Leyen is currently on a four-day tour of Europe&#x27;s eastern flank to speak to nations on the &quot;frontline&quot; of Russian hybrid threats.</p><p>&quot;The EU will continue to invest into defence spending and in Europe&#x27;s readiness even more after this incident,&quot; the EU confirmed.</p><h4>What is GPS jamming?</h4><p>The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is the term used to group satellite-based navigation systems, including the Global Positioning System, or GPS, which is a United States-run network of satellites.</p><p>GPS provides precise locations, time and altitude data to users.</p><p>GPS jamming uses ground-based signals to block or overpower the signal — and it is easy to do, according to Flinders University professor of wireless system security Sam Drake.</p><blockquote><p>&quot;It&#x27;s extremely easy to do that with a few hundred dollars worth of equipment,&quot; Professor Drake said.</p></blockquote><p>StrategicAir pilot and consultant director Tony Stanton said the satellites were in medium Earth orbit, about 20,000 kilometres above Earth.</p><p>He said by the time the radio frequency got to an aircraft, it was &quot;very, very weak&quot; and a person did not need &quot;a very powerful transmitter of the same frequency to be louder than the satellite&quot;.</p><p>When a system is jammed, it might have to be switched off for the duration of the flight, which can cause delays to take-off and landing.</p><p>In terms of Ms von der Leyen&#x27;s flight to Bulgaria, the GPS jamming caused approximately 10 minutes of delays.</p><p>&quot;There was very little distraction to the aircraft in this case,&quot; Dr Stanton said.</p><p>Another form of GPS hacking is &quot;spoofing&quot;, where an aircraft is sent a false signal so it has inaccurate location data.</p><p>&quot;Spoofing is much more sophisticated and more dangerous … it is where the other signal actually tries to imitate the satellite signal and give it a false time or a false position,&quot; Dr Stanton said.</p><p>&quot;What is dangerous about that is that [it] doesn&#x27;t necessarily give an error alert to the pilot.&quot;</p><h4>Does Russia do this a lot?</h4><p>According to Professor Sussex, Russia does do this a lot.</p><p>&quot;The Russians have been doing it since about 2014,&quot; he said.</p><p>&quot;The Russians will try all sorts of means below the threshold of war, and GPS jamming is one of them that will make life difficult for Europeans.&quot;</p><p>These attacks were designed to show Europe that &quot;no-one&quot; was safe from Russia, he said.</p><p>The region had experienced &quot;a lot of such jamming and spoofing activities&quot;, an European Commission spokesperson said.</p><p>The EU has sanctioned several companies believed to be involved.</p><p>In July this year, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) asked Russia to cease GPS interference.</p><p>ICAO said <a href="https://www.icao.int/sites/default/files/Meetings/a42/Documents/WP/wp_108_en.pdf">in their request</a> to Russia that the disruptions had forced aircraft, ships, and drones to alter their routes.</p><p>Professor Sussex added that Russia would often pay criminals in different countries in Europe to do these kinds of attacks.</p><p>&quot;They are often paid quietly through bitcoin but sometimes they are directly in contact with the Russian military intelligence or the FSB,&quot; he said.</p><p>EU Defence Commissioner Andrius Kubilius said the 27-nation bloc would increase its number of satellites in low orbit to enhance detection of interference.</p><p>Professor Sussex said Russia was sending the message that the longer the EU resisted, the worse these kind of attacks would get.</p><p>&quot;It&#x27;s reinforcing the Russian approach to be information operations, which is to convey the message we&#x27;re present, we&#x27;re everywhere and we can we can reach out and make life difficult for you,&quot; he said.</p><h4>Could it happen in Australia?</h4><p>In short, yes it could. </p><p>However Dr Stanton said there had been no major reported GNSS or GPS jamming events in Australia.</p><p>He said even if there was, all major Australian airports had conventional navigation aids for pilots to use if they needed to that did not rely on GNSS or GPS.</p><p>&quot;I think ultimately it would be more of an inconvenience rather than a safety issue if somebody did that here in Australia,&quot; Dr Stanton said.</p><p>The action of GPS jamming is also outright illegal in Australia.</p><p>The Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) classifies GPS jammers as prohibited and there are fines up to $330,000 and/or up to two years in prison for possession, operation, supply, or offering to supply such devices.</p><p>&quot;Our skies are well protected,&quot; Dr Stanton said.</p><p>&quot;We&#x27;ve got the laws that restrict the purchase of these things and using these things, and ultimately our pilots are well trained to use conventional navigation aides.</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Our pilots always have the means of navigating and landing safely in Australia.&quot;</p></blockquote></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>Last week, Israel assassinated 12 senior Houthi figures — including their prime minister — in a strike on Yemen&#x27;s capital of Sanaa.</p><p>Thousands of mourners attended a funeral for the slain officials on Monday, chanting the Houthi slogan:</p><pullquote><p>God is Great, Death to America, Death to Israel, Curse on the Jews, Victory to Islam.</p></pullquote><p>Meanwhile, Mohammed Miftah, the now de facto head of the Houthi government, vowed revenge.</p><p>Experts say this latest attack from Israel is a &quot;significant blow&quot; to the Iran-backed rebel group.</p><p>But how much has it actually weakened the Houthis?</p><p>Here&#x27;s what we know.</p><h4>What happened?</h4><p>Israel launched the dramatic strike on Thursday, local time.</p><p>It targeted a group of senior officials who had gathered to watch a televised speech recorded by the movement&#x27;s ultimate leader, Abdul Malik Al-Houthi.</p><p>The Middle East Institute&#x27;s Nadwa Al Dawsari said the strikes signalled a &quot;shift&quot; in Israel&#x27;s strategy in Yemen from primarily striking infrastructure to &quot;actively targeting&quot; Houthi leadership.</p><h4>Who was killed in the strike?</h4><p>Almost the entire Houthi cabinet was wiped out in the strike.</p><p>This included the group&#x27;s prime minister, Ahmed al-Rahawi.</p><p>However, it remains unclear if Israel&#x27;s primary targets — chief of staff Muhammad Abd al-Karim al-Ghamari and powerful defence minister Mohamed al-Atifi — were killed.</p><p>Top leader Al-Houthi also wasn&#x27;t among the casualties.</p><h4>Why did Israel launch the attack?</h4><p>The strikes were in retaliation for the Houthis&#x27; August 22 launch of a ballistic missile towards Israel — the group&#x27;s first use of a cluster bomb during the current conflict with Israel, according to the IDF.</p><p>The Houthis have previously <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-12-04/who-are-yemens-houthi-rebels-role-in-israel-gaza-war/103185598">launched attacks</a> on Israel and ships in the Red Sea in relation to the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.</p><a href="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Ec4RQ/3/?abcnewsembedheight=370">[MAP: strike]</a><p>Israel&#x27;s defence minister, Israel Katz warned this latest attack was &quot;just the beginning&quot;, adding &quot;the Houthis will learn the hard way that whoever threatens and harms Israel will be harmed sevenfold&quot;.</p><h4>How much has this strike weakened the Houthis?</h4><p>The Houthis&#x27; top decision-makers weren&#x27;t among those killed in the strike, according to Ms Al Dawsari.</p><p>Nevertheless, she said the annihilation of nearly the entire cabinet represented &quot;a significant blow&quot; to the rebel group.</p><blockquote><p>&quot;It exposes the Houthis&#x27; vulnerabilities and shatters the image of strength the group seeks to project,&quot; she said.</p></blockquote><p>&quot;It demonstrates that Israel now possesses the intelligence and operational reach to target Houthi leaders inside Yemen with precision.&quot;</p><p>Australian National University international relations expert Charles Miller said the strike might prompt a brief reduction in Houthi activity.</p><blockquote><p>&quot;But in the long run, I can&#x27;t really see it having much of an effect because they&#x27;re such a well-established group,&quot; he said.</p></blockquote><h4>How have the Houthis responded?</h4><p>The strike has left the Houthis paranoid about leaks, according to Ms Al Dawsari.</p><p>She said the group would likely launch &quot;frantic internal hunts&quot;, draining resources and sowing distrust.</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Local sources already report that the group has arrested several of its own members suspected of passing information to Israel,&quot; she said.</p></blockquote><p>Dr Miller agreed.</p><p>&quot;That&#x27;s one of the reasons why countries like Israel do strikes like this because it starts to set people against one another,&quot; he said.</p><p>However, Ms Al Dawsari said this strike would not neutralise the Houthis for long.</p><p>&quot;Instead, the group will weaponise [the strike] to tighten repression, indoctrinate children, justify forced recruitment and sustain its narrative of perpetual war,&quot; Ms Al Dawsari said.</p><blockquote><p>&quot;These steps will strengthen the group over time.&quot;</p></blockquote><h4>What&#x27;s next?</h4><p>The Houthis have vowed revenge.</p><p>&quot;Our military approach to targeting the Israeli enemy, whether with missiles, drones or the naval blockade, is a continuous, steady and escalating one,&quot; Al-Houthi said in a speech following the strike.</p><p>Meanwhile, Israel&#x27;s prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said this was &quot;only the beginning&quot; of Israel&#x27;s campaign to eliminate senior Houthi officials, according to a <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/security-said-boosted-around-israeli-leaders-amid-houthi-revenge-threats/">Times of Israel report</a>.</p><blockquote><p>&quot;We will reach all of them,&quot; he said.</p></blockquote></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>For the first time in Indonesia&#x27;s democratic history, mobs have looted the homes of several members of parliament and a government minister.</p><p>The looting followed violent nationwide protests against MP allowances, which left one 21-year old food delivery worker dead after being struck by an armoured police vehicle and more than 460 people hospitalised in Jakarta alone, according to official figures.</p><p>Deadly riots were also reported in several other cities across the archipelago with a total of seven people killed.</p><p>Over the weekend, dozens of mobs targeted the home of Ahmad Sahroni, a MP from the National Democrat Party, or Nasdem.</p><p>His unoccupied house was broken into, with looters seizing collections of expensive watches, designer bags, jewellery, and even a safe box.</p><p>Videos of the looting quickly spread across social media platforms, including TikTok.</p><p>One video showed his luxury sports car had been destroyed by the mob.</p><p>Images also showed looters taking a life-sized Iron Man figurine from the property.</p><p>Mr Sahroni recently drew significant online criticism for saying that people who want the current Indonesian parliament dissolved were &quot;the dumbest people in the world&quot;.</p><p>During the looting, social media users speculated about his whereabouts, with some claiming he had fled overseas.</p><p>Mr Sahroni&#x27;s whereabouts remain unknown.</p><p>The ABC understands that the addresses of the MPs were leaked and then shared on social media platforms.</p><h4>Finance minister apologises</h4><p>After her private residence in Jakarta was looted over the weekend, finance minister Sri Mulyani made a public apology on Monday.</p><p>She did not reference specific thefts, but said &quot;thank you for the sympathy and moral support&quot; following the incident which she described as a &quot;disaster&quot;.</p><p>&quot;We apologise for any shortcomings. In the name of God, we will continue improving,&quot; she wrote on her Instagram post.</p><p>There has been mounting criticism of Ms Mulyani over her plan to boost state revenue by raising taxes.</p><p>Bonar Tigor Naipospos, from human rights group the Setara Institute, told the ABC that it was not clear who was involved or responsible for the looting.</p><p>&quot;It&#x27;s interesting to see mobs were looting politicians and officials for the first time in our history,&quot; Mr Naipospos said.</p><p>&quot;But as some reports suggested, it seems that it has been planned.&quot;</p><p>He said it appeared that both the protests and the subsequent thefts involved several groups that had their own &quot;interests&quot;.</p><p>&quot;At the end of the day, it seems like someone, or some groups, would like to take advantage of the unrest,&quot; he said.</p><p>On Monday, Communications Minister Meutya Hafid said officials had &quot;detected significant flows of money&quot; through digital platforms linked to the riots and looting.</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Violent and anarchic acts were live-streamed and monetised through large donations and &#x27;gifts&#x27;,&quot; she said in a statement.</p></blockquote><p>&quot;Several of the accounts involved were reportedly connected to online gambling networks.&quot;</p><p>Ms Hafid said the government respected the public&#x27;s right to protest and express its views.</p><p>&quot;However, officials also noted that certain groups appeared to be deliberately mobilised via social media, directed to specific locations, streaming content continuously, and receiving unusually large payments,&quot; she said.</p><p>Reports emerged that a live-streaming feature of TikTok was no longer working in Indonesia, but Jakarta said it was a voluntary decision by parent company, ByteDance.</p><p>In a statement, the company confirmed that the feature would be suspended in Indonesia for &quot;the next few days&quot;.</p><h4>Celebrities-turned-politicians also targeted</h4><p>Surya Utama, known as Uya Kuya, was a celebrity-turned-politician and represented the city of Jakarta in Indonesia&#x27;s parliament.</p><p>His house was also destroyed and looted.</p><p>Local media reported that his cats were stolen from the property, prompting his wife, who is also an MP, to plea for their return.</p><p>Police said they had arrested seven people involved, but none had yet been charged.</p><p>&quot;It&#x27;s OK. I accept it. But I just hope people see the kind of work I&#x27;ve done all this time,&quot; Mr Utama said to local media.</p><blockquote><p>&quot;What really makes me sad is that even the cats, living creatures, were looted,&quot; he said.</p></blockquote><p>Mr Utama&#x27;s house, often referred to as &quot;the white castle&quot;, has been featured on television programs several times and reviewed on YouTube.</p><p>Under former president Joko Widodo, public officials were barred from flexing their wealth publicly or online.</p><p>The residence of Nafa Urbach, a former actress and singer, was also targeted, but media reports later said it ws not her house but her ex-husband&#x27;s.</p><p>Eko Hendro Purnomo, a former comedian, was also subjected to looting on Saturday night.</p><p>Police said mobs came at three different times and they were most likely not coming from his neighbourhood.</p><p>The three former entertainers have attracted criticism over their comments about MP perks, which many perceived as &quot;mocking&quot; the public.</p><p>Five MPs, including the four targeted by thieves, were dropped by the political parties following the unrest.</p><p>Each of the former entertainers made public apologies on their social media accounts.</p><p>Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto said he would cut housing allowances for MPs and suspend them from taking overseas work trips following days of unrest across the country.</p><p>In a nationally televised press conference on Sunday night, he also said he had ordered the military and police to &quot;take firm action&quot; in response to the burning and looting.</p><p>Despite that warning, thousands again hit the streets on Monday.</p><p>Some 500 protesters gathered outside the parliament in Jakarta, before dispersing before sundown in line with orders from Mr Subianto.</p><p>But protesters clashed with police in Gorontalo city on Sulawesi island, with police firing tear gas and water cannons to try and disperse crowd.</p><p>In Bandung, on Java island, protesters threw Molotov cocktails and fireworks at the provincial council building.</p><p>Thousands more rallied in Palembang, on Sumatra island, and hundreds gathered separately in Banjarmasin, on Borneo island, and Yogyakarta, on the main island of Java, and Makassar, on Sulawesi, according to AFP journalists around the country.</p><p>Schools and universities in Jakarta were holding classes online until at least Tuesday, and civil servants based in the city were asked to work from home.</p></div>]]></content:encoded>

          </figure><div><p>Journalists in Australia are among dozens of reporters who fear for their lives and those of family members after receiving death threats from the Iranian regime. </p><p>Legal experts have warned if governments do not work together to hold Iran to account, a &quot;journalist could die on the streets of Melbourne simply for doing their job&quot;.</p><p>Iran International, a news outlet headquartered in London that broadcasts into Iran and across the world, said its journalists had experienced an &quot;alarming escalation&quot; in threats over the past few weeks, since the 12-day Iran-Israel war.</p><p>The organisation&#x27;s Australia correspondent based in Melbourne, Alireza Mohebbi, told the ABC his family in Iran had been targeted.</p><p>&quot;It&#x27;s very stressful, the Islamic Republic&#x27;s regime has called my family and threatened if they don&#x27;t get me to stop working at Iran International TV, there will be consequences,&quot; he said.</p><p>&quot;I&#x27;m worried about my family in Iran. The regime is very aggressive about the work we are doing at Iran International.&quot;</p><p>Iran International said 45 of its journalists in eight countries and more than 300 relatives had received threats, with family members hauled in for questioning and some detained in Iran.</p><p>Some journalists have reportedly been followed, had trackers put on their cars and received sexual harassment and abuse online.</p><p>Others have been threatened that they and their relatives will be killed if they continue their work.</p><p>&quot;Over the past few weeks, the level of threats against our journalists have increased dramatically,&quot; Iran International&#x27;s executive news editor, Aliasghar Ramezanpoor, said.</p><p>&quot;It&#x27;s obvious to us that this is because of our coverage about what is happening in Iran.</p><p>&quot;The government is concerned about our coverage because we go beyond the censorship processes they have.&quot;</p><p>Iran strictly controls media in the country but Iran International, which launched in 2017, is an independent outlet that often criticises the regime&#x27;s leadership and circumvents censorship by broadcasting from outside the country.</p><p>Legal counsel for Iran International, Caoilfhionn Gallagher, said the regime had accused journalists of being spies for Israel, without any justification.</p><p>&quot;Iran has made very clear that it wishes to assassinate an Iran international journalist to send a message,&quot; she said.</p><p>&quot;I&#x27;m afraid that unless robust action is taken by multiple states acting together around the world to hold Iran to account for what it&#x27;s doing, we are going to see a journalist die on the streets of London or the streets in Washington or the streets of Melbourne simply for doing their job.&quot;</p><p>The ABC has contacted the Iranian government for comment. </p><p>Iran International presenter Pouria Zeraati was repeatedly stabbed outside his London home on Good Friday last year after receiving repeated threats for months.</p><p>Two men have been charged over the attack and Zeraati has moved abroad for his safety.</p><p>&quot;What happened in that attack was very worrying,&quot; Ms Gallagher said.</p><p>&quot;These were individuals flown in specifically to conduct the attack, which happened on Good Friday, when law enforcement responses were perhaps slower than usual. And we see that increasingly with Iran. It targets times when parliaments are away.&quot;</p><p>Eleven United Nations experts have condemned Iran&#x27;s intensifying repression of Iran International journalists across the world, as well as the growing intimidation of their family members living in Iran.</p><p>&quot;We are deeply concerned by credible threats to the lives and safety of journalists … this campaign is an attempt to silence and censor critical reporting and courageous public interest journalism by a fragile government that appears afraid of legitimate criticism,&quot; the experts said in a statement released on August 21.</p><p>&quot;We urge Iran to immediately stop threatening and intimidating journalists and their families, and obstructing healthy public debate in democratic societies.&quot;</p><p>In July, Iran&#x27;s parliament introduced a bill that expands the criminal offence of espionage to include contact with foreign and diaspora media outlets.</p><p>It means Iran International reporters are technically classified as terrorists in Iran, so if they call their family in Tehran, their family members could be arrested for speaking with an international fugitive.</p><p>Mr Mohebbi says he has not spoken to his family in months for fear of reprisals.</p><p>He is worried the threats could increase further after Australia expelled Iran&#x27;s ambassador over accusations the government directed antisemitic arson attacks in Sydney and Melbourne.</p><p>&quot;This is a big concern of the Iranian people and Iranian community in Australia, that after expelling the ambassador, the regime wants to put more pressure on us,&quot; he said.</p><p>&quot;Especially because we had extensive coverage about the issue on Iran International.&quot;</p><p>Ms Gallagher said there were fears that the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps could next target small newsrooms, including in Melbourne.</p><p>&quot;As security has ramped up at the two main headquarters in the US and UK, we&#x27;re increasingly seeing attacks being carried out in smaller bureaus,&quot; she said.</p><p>&quot;Last year there was a foiled plot to assassinate an Iran International journalist in Sweden, and we are worried about other locations, including Melbourne.&quot;</p><p>She said the journalists who knew they had been blacklisted when they left Iran to report on the country were showing a huge amount of courage to continue working.</p><p>&quot;Increasingly, what I&#x27;m finding is that being a journalist reporting on Iran, wherever in the world you may be, is an act of bravery,&quot; she said.</p><p>&quot;These people are heroes, standing up to do their job and being targeted by a bully state with very frightening and horrendous tactics. It&#x27;s remarkable so many of my clients are continuing to do their job in the face of this abuse.&quot;</p><p>Mohebbi, who moved to Australia from Iran in 2010 to pursue journalism, has vowed to continue his passion.</p><p>&quot;I&#x27;m committed to what I am doing. Threats cannot stop me,&quot; he said.</p></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>Desperate searches are continuing as rescuers try to find those trapped and injured following an earthquake in Afghanistan that has killed at least 800 people and injured some 2,800 others.</p><p>The Taliban has called for international aid following the magnitude-6.0 earthquake, which struck near the city of Jalalabad just before midnight on Sunday, local time.</p><p>At least 812 people were killed in the eastern provinces of Kunar and Nangarhar, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said.</p><p>Local authorities have warned that number is likely to rise once rescuers reach more isolated areas.</p><p>The disaster will further stretch the resources of the war-torn nation&#x27;s Taliban administration, which had already been grappling with crises ranging from a sharp drop in foreign aid to deportations of hundreds of thousands of Afghans by neighbouring countries.</p><p>Sharafat Zaman, spokesperson for the health ministry in Kabul, called for international help to aid recovery efforts.</p><p>&quot;We need it because here lots of people lost their lives and houses,&quot; he told Reuters.</p><p>Some villagers sat weeping amid the piled ruins of their homes while others began laboriously clearing the debris by hand, or carried out the injured on makeshift stretchers.</p><p>&quot;This is Mazar Dara in Nurgal district. The entire village has been destroyed,&quot; one victim told reporters.</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Children and elders are trapped under the rubble. We need urgent help.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Another survivor said they &quot;need ambulances, we need doctors, we need everything to rescue the injured and recover the dead&quot;.</p><p>Ziaul Haq Mohammadi, a student at Al-Falah University in the eastern city of Jalalabad, was studying in his room at home when the earthquake struck.</p><p>He said he tried to stand up but was knocked over by the power of the tremor.</p><p>&quot;We spent the whole night in fear and anxiety because at any moment another earthquake could happen,&quot; Mr Mohammadi said.</p><p>Relatively shallow earthquakes can cause severe damage in Afghanistan, especially because the majority of people live in low-rise, mud-brick homes vulnerable to collapse.</p><h4>India and China offer help</h4><p>Rescuers are struggling to reach many mountainous areas cut off from mobile networks along the border with Pakistan, where heavy rains have also exacerbated access issues.</p><p>With many roads impassable because of landslides, helicopters are being used to ferry the dead and injured out of the earthquake zone.</p><p>Roads remained blocked nearly 20 hours after the earthquake, despite residents&#x27; efforts to clear the way.</p><p>&quot;The search operation is still going on. Many people are stuck under the rubble of their roofs,&quot; the disaster management head in eastern Kunar province, Ehsanullah Ehsan, told AFP, warning the death toll could rise.</p><a href="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/3p7An/1/?abcnewsembedheight=400">[map]</a><p>After the Taliban initially said that no countries had offered to help with the recovery, both India and China said they were willing to help.</p><p>A spokesperson for China&#x27;s foreign ministry said it was ready to provide disaster relief assistance &quot;according to Afghanistan&#x27;s needs and within its capacity&quot;.</p><p>Meanwhile, Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said the country had delivered 1,000 family tents to Kabul and was moving 15 tonnes of food material to Kunar, with more relief material to be sent from India starting on Tuesday.</p><p>UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres said the organisation&#x27;s mission in Afghanistan was preparing to help those in areas devastated by the quake.</p><p>In a post shared by the Vatican, Pope Leo XIV said he was &quot;deeply saddened by the significant loss of life caused by the earthquake in the area of eastern Afghanistan&quot;.</p><p>Afghanistan is prone to deadly earthquakes, particularly in the Hindu Kush mountain range, where the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates meet.</p><p>Since 1900, there have been 12 earthquakes with magnitudes greater than seven in north-east Afghanistan, according to Brian Baptie, a seismologist at the British Geological Survey.</p><p>&quot;This scale of the seismic activity, the potential for multi-hazard events and the construction of structures in the region can combine to create significant loss of life in such events,&quot; he said.</p><p>Since the return of the Taliban in 2021, foreign aid to Afghanistan has been slashed, undermining the impoverished nation&#x27;s already hamstrung ability to respond to disasters.</p><p>About 85 per cent of the Afghan population lives on less than $1 a day, according to the UN Development Programme.</p><p><strong>ABC/wires</strong></p></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin have met in China in a show of deepening ties between the two countries as New Delhi&#x27;s relationship with Washington sours over the purchase of Russian oil.</p><p>The two leaders held talks after attending the key session of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) gathering in the port city of Tianjin, where discussions focused on regional stability, bilateral trade and energy cooperation.</p><p>In his remarks to open the talks, Mr Modi termed the partnership with Moscow as &quot;special and privileged&quot;. </p><p>Mr Putin addressed Mr Modi as a &quot;dear friend&quot; and hailed Russia&#x27;s ties with India as special, friendly and trusting.</p><p>&quot;Russia and India have maintained special relations for decades. Friendly, trusting. This is the foundation for the development of our relations in the future,&quot; Mr Putin said.</p><p>&quot;These relations are absolutely non-partisan in nature, supported by the overwhelming majority of the peoples of our countries.&quot;</p><p>The Russian leader plans to travel to India in December for the 23rd India-Russia annual summit, according to his foreign affairs adviser, Yuri Ushakov.</p><p>Mr Modi used the SCO meeting to welcome the peace initiatives aimed at halting the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and called on the stakeholders to move forward constructively.</p><blockquote><p>&quot;To end the conflict soonest and establish peace permanently, we need to find out a way. It&#x27;s a call of the entire humanity,&quot; Mr Modi said.</p></blockquote><p>At the talks, Mr Putin was accompanied by a large delegation that included top government officials.</p><p>Russian state media reported that before the formal dialogue, the two leaders spoke one-on-one for almost an hour in Aurus, a high-end, Russian-made limousine that Mr Putin regularly brings on foreign trips.</p><p>The meeting came days after US President Donald Trump imposed an additional 25 per cent tariffs on Indian imports, raising the total duties to a steep 50 per cent, in retaliation to India&#x27;s continued purchases of discounted Russian oil.</p><p>Washington has repeatedly warned New Delhi against buying Russian crude which it said was partly keeping Moscow&#x27;s revenues afloat to fund the Ukraine war. India has defended its imports as essential for meeting the growing energy needs of 1.4 billion people.</p><h4>Another public show of strengthening ties</h4><p>In July last year, Mr Modi visited Russia for talks with Mr Putin, his first trip to the country since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine by the Kremlin&#x27;s forces in February 2022.</p><p>He then travelled to Kazan in October for the summit of the BRICS bloc of developing economies.</p><p>Russia has had strong ties with India since the Cold War, and New Delhi&#x27;s importance as a key trading partner has grown since the war between Moscow and Ukraine.</p><p>China and India have become key buyers of Russian oil after the West shunned Russian exports to punish Moscow.</p><p>India historically bought most of its crude from the Middle East, but the world&#x27;s third-largest crude importer after China and the US has started buying Russian oil available at discounted rates.</p><p>Russia now accounts for around 37 per cent of India&#x27;s total oil imports, according to analysts and Indian officials.</p><p>Trade between India and Russia has sharply increased in recent years, touching a record $68.7 billion ($104b) in the 2024-25 financial year.</p><p>Imports from Russia reached around $64 billion ($97.6b) and exports from India totalled about $5 billion ($7.6b), as per Indian government data.</p><p>India&#x27;s financial year runs from April to March. The two nations aspire to bolster the trade to $100 billion ($152.6b) by 2030.</p><p>Monday&#x27;s meeting underscored New Delhi&#x27;s stance that India prized its old and reliable strategic partners and has sufficient strategic autonomy in its foreign policy to maintain and strengthen its multi-dimensional partnership, said Sreeram Sundar Chaulia, an international affairs expert at New Delhi&#x27;s Jindal School of International Affairs.</p><p>At the same time, the Indian government hopes the present rough weather between India and the US is a temporary aberration, he added.</p><p>&quot;Then, India can return happily to having the Russian cake and eating the American pie as part of its multi-alignment strategy,&quot; Mr Chaulia said.</p><p><strong>AP/ABC</strong></p></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>A US judge has halted the Trump administration from deporting a group of 10 migrant Guatemalan children who had already boarded planes in Texas after their lawyers made a pre-dawn emergency appeal during a holiday weekend.</p><p>District Judge Sparkle Sooknanan issued a temporary restraining order from Washington DC blocking the removal of the children, aged 10-17, for 14 days.</p><p>The order was expanded to include any Guatemalan unaccompanied minors in the custody of the US Department of Health and Human Services.</p><p>The complaint said this group could number hundreds of children.</p><h4>Why are migrant children being targeted for deportation?</h4><p>President Donald Trump launched an immigration crackdown after returning to the White House in January, including an effort to track down and deport unaccompanied migrant children.</p><p>Migrant children who arrive at US borders without a parent or guardian are classified as unaccompanied.</p><p>They are sent to government-run shelters until they can be placed with a family member or foster home, a process outlined in federal law.</p><p>Many of those from Guatemala request asylum or pursue other legal avenues to seek permission to stay.</p><p>Part of Mr Trump&#x27;s election pitch last year was the &quot;largest deportation operation in US history&quot;.</p><p>His administration struck an agreement with Guatemala that would allow unaccompanied children to be sent back to the country and planned to start deportations last weekend, one current and two former US officials told Reuters. </p><p>The government is planning to remove nearly 700 Guatemalan children who came to the US unaccompanied, according to a letter sent last Friday by Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat.</p><p>Guatemalan President Bernardo Arevalo said in July that his government was working with the US to repatriate unaccompanied children.</p><h4>What is known about the children?</h4><p>The 10 plaintiffs, aged 10-17, include a 10-year-old indigenous Guatemalan girl whose mother had died and who had suffered abuse and neglect from other caretakers, the complaint said. </p><p>The girl was detained at a US government shelter in South Texas, the complaint said.</p><p>The children have been in shelters or foster care in California, Texas, Pennsylvania and New York. </p><h4>Why are the children potentially at risk if they return to Guatemala?</h4><p>In their complaint on Sunday, the National Immigration Law Center and Young Center for Immigrant Children&#x27;s Rights said the deportations would be a &quot;clear violation of the unambiguous protections that Congress has provided them as vulnerable children&quot;.</p><p>Guatemala has high rates of poverty and inequality with the World Bank reporting that in 2024, 57.3 per cent of Guatemalans were living in poverty, with an average income of $US6.85 ($10.50) per day.</p><p>Australian travel advice says to exercise a high degree of caution in Guatemala due to the threat of violent crime.</p><p>Lawyers for the children said that, in Guatemala, they &quot;may face abuse, neglect, persecution, or even torture, against their best interests&quot;.</p><p>Several of the 10 plaintiffs had expressed fear of returning to Guatemala, the complaint said.</p><p>One 16-year-old girl said her parents, in Guatemala, had received a strange phone call a few weeks ago saying the US was deporting her, lawyer Efrén C Olivares said.</p><p>The girl, who has been living in a New York shelter, said in a court filing that she is an honours student about to start 11th grade, loves living in the US and is &quot;deeply afraid of being deported&quot;.</p><p>Other children — identified only by their initials — said in court documents that they had been neglected, abandoned, physically threatened or abused in their home country.</p><p>&quot;I do not have any family in Guatemala that can take good care of me,&quot; a 10-year-old said in a court filing. </p><p>A 16-year-old said there had been &quot;threats against my life&quot; in Guatemala.</p><p>&quot;If I am sent back, I believe I will be in danger,&quot; the teenager added.</p><h4>What is the Trump administration saying?</h4><p>A government lawyer confirmed that the children who it had planned to fly to Guatemala had been taken off the planes and were being returned to the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement. </p><p>White House Deputy Chief of Staff, Stephen Miller, criticised Justice Sooknanan for blocking the deportations.</p><p>&quot;The minors have all self-reported that their parents are back home in Guatemala,&quot; Miller wrote on X. &quot;But a Democrat judge is refusing to let them reunify with their parents.&quot;</p><h4>Why have these planes been halted?</h4><p>In March, there was a weekend showdown over the deportation of hundreds of Venezuelans to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador. </p><p>In that case, the judge appeared in civilian clothes for a Saturday night hearing and tried to block the flights. But they went ahead, with the government saying the court order came too late.</p><p>In last weekend&#x27;s case minutes after Justice Sooknanan&#x27;s hearing, five charter buses pulled up to a plane at Valley International Airport in Harlingen, Texas, a hub for deportation flights. </p><p>Hours earlier, authorities had walked dozens of passengers toward the plane in an area restricted to government aircraft.</p><p>Justice Sooknanan said she was awakened at 2.30am to address the emergency filing from the children&#x27;s lawyers, who wrote in bold type that flights might be leaving within the next two-to-four hours.</p><p>During the emergency hearing on Sunday, the judge pressed the Department of Justice for assurances that Guatemalan children had not aleady been deported.</p><p>Justice Department attorney Drew Ensign said no children had been removed but that some had been loaded onto aircraft.</p><p>Ensign said he believed one plane may have taken off but later returned under the judge&#x27;s order and that the children would be moved back to shelters.</p><p>Justice Sooknanan spent hours trying to reach federal attorneys and get answers, she said.</p><p>&quot;I have the government attempting to remove unaccompanied minors from the country in the wee hours of the morning on a holiday weekend, which is surprising,&quot; she said at the hearing.</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Absent action by the courts, all of those children would have been returned to Guatemala, potentially to very dangerous situations.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>While the ruling stopped children being deported, adult migrants were still sent back to Guatemala.</p><h4>What happens next?</h4><p>Sunday&#x27;s court hearing came in a case filed in federal court in Washington, but similar legal actions were enforced elsewhere.</p><p>In a lawsuit in Arizona, the Florence Immigrant &amp; Refugee Rights Project said one of its clients is a 12-year-old asylum-seeker who has chronic kidney disease, needs dialysis to stay alive and will need a kidney transplant. </p><p>Two other plaintiffs, a 10-year-old boy and his 3-year-old sister don&#x27;t have family in Guatemala and don&#x27;t want to return, according to the group.</p><p>Guatemalan children who arrived at the border without their parents or guardians will stay for at least two weeks while the legal fight unfolds, according to the ruling.</p><p>&quot;I do not want there to be any ambiguity,&quot; Judge Sparkle Sooknanan said.</p></div>]]></content:encoded>

          </figure><div><p>Samoa&#x27;s likely new prime minister has announced that &quot;the era of God-centred leadership&quot; has begun in the country after the provisional results of its snap election have shown a new government will almost certainly be formed.</p><p>La&#x27;auli Leuatea Schmidt, the leader of the country&#x27;s FAST party, claimed victory from Friday&#x27;s national poll after provisional results showed his party picked up as many as 30 seats in the 51-seat parliament.</p><p>Caretaker Prime Minister Fiame Naomi Mata&#x27;afa, who has stayed silent since Friday&#x27;s poll, looked almost certain to lose her title as the country&#x27;s leader, with her party, the Samoa United Party, only picking up three seats.</p><p>Fiame, the country&#x27;s first female leader, previously led the FAST party until <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/pacific/programs/pacificbeat/samoa-update/104983042">she removed Mr Schmidt</a> earlier this year after he was charged with a string of criminal offences, which are still to be heard in court.</p><p>She was later abandoned by the party, triggering a long-running political scandal that led to the election.</p><p>Long-term former leader of Samoa, Tuila&#x27;epa Sa&#x27;ilele Malielegaoi, looked set to remain in opposition after his party, HRPP, picked up about 12 seats.</p><p>The provisional results will be confirmed later this week in an &quot;official&quot; vote count, although in Samoa court cases and appeals can often delay the process of officially crowning a new government and a new leader.</p><p>But the overwhelming result from the FAST Party in the provisional results means it is almost certain to form government, barring any successful court cases and an unprecedented swing in some votes that are yet to be counted.</p><h4>&#x27;The result is clear&#x27;</h4><p>Speaking at a thanksgiving church service on Sunday, local time, in which he claimed victory, Mr Schmidt thanked his supporters and praised the guidance of his religion.</p><p>&quot;Our country may have been divided by politics, but our foundation remains firm: Samoa is founded on God,&quot; Mr Schmidt said, <a href="https://www.samoaobserver.ws/category/election/115911?fbclid=IwY2xjawMhrBxleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHk7VmfIayHKwbiWfHPikVAYu0gp5MMGI5p3dfuOP40OHpCXtWZqCpxuADjlF_aem_pk5NMo3Dbp_Rl0KmepBSTA">as reported by the Samoa Observer. </a></p><p>&quot;This moment belongs to Him.&quot;</p><p>Mr Schmidt, a popular leader despite his impending criminal cases, also referenced the long-running political turmoil that has engulfed the country, triggering Friday&#x27;s election.</p><p>&quot;We apologise to Samoa for the hardships endured during the long road to finding a government,&quot; he said.</p><p>&quot;Since God blessed Samoa with FAST in 2021, the nation has faced many trials, and at times, we were even separated from our initial members earlier this year.</p><blockquote><p>&quot;The result is clear [in] Samoa, FAST has prevailed because we are blessed by God.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The reactions on the ground in the capital, Apia, have so far been based on party lines, with FAST party supporters celebrating at various events over the weekend. But supporters of the other parties have had low-key events, processing the results.</p><p>The election itself was peaceful, with only a small number of issues around contested results and the count itself.</p><p>However, the HRPP&#x27;s Tuila&#x27;epa Sa&#x27;ilele Malielegaoi has since indicated he will challenge results in court.</p><p>Despite this challenge and the pending court cases, the provisional results over the weekend almost certainly end the reign of the country&#x27;s first female prime minister.</p><p>Fiame has been labelled by some as a trailblazer who led in a new direction of accountability and more democratic rule.</p><p>But questions remained over her government&#x27;s handling of the cost of living crisis, persistent power outages and the health system, as Samoa continues to grapple with a <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-08-14/dengue-fever-outbreak-pacific-islands/105625430">dengue fever outbreak </a>that has killed multiple children.</p><p>As the first female leader of the country, Fiame also encountered a wave of gendered attacks and was once told in parliament she should have married so she could have been &quot;advised&quot; better.</p></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>The arrest of former president Ranil Wickremesinghe has up-ended Sri Lanka&#x27;s political landscape.</p><p>For the first time in the country&#x27;s history, a former head of state has been detained on corruption charges.</p><p>But observers say his arrest raises questions about the direction of the country&#x27;s new government, led by Anura Kumara Dissanayake, and about whether it strengthens or undermines a fragile economic recovery.</p><h4>Questions over priorities</h4><p>Mr Wickremesinghe is accused of misusing public funds to stop over in Britain and attend a university ceremony in London where his wife received an honorary professorship, after he made an official visit to Cuba and the United States, according to local media.</p><p>The former president maintains that no state funds were used for the visit to Britain.</p><p>His party says he is innocent and that the case against him is politically motivated — which Mr Dissanayake denies.</p><p>Mr Wickremesinghe, who served as Sri Lanka&#x27;s president from 2022 to 2024, was released on bail this week.</p><p>Yet, to many observers, the charges prosecutors have chosen to pursue against him feel oddly underwhelming.</p><p>&quot;This particular incident is a puzzle because the grounds [on] which they have gone for him seem quite minor,&quot; said Ganeshan Wignaraja, a political analyst based in Colombo.</p><p>&quot;Time will tell whether this is making a mountain out of rather a trivial thing.&quot;</p><p>Others said the case was symbolic of the government&#x27;s commitment to tackling alleged corruption.</p><blockquote><p>&quot;It is sending a message that no one is above the law when you see someone as powerful as Ranil Wickremesinghe in handcuffs,&quot; said Meenakshi Ganguly, deputy director of Human Rights Watch&#x27;s Asia Division.</p></blockquote><p>&quot;However, while it is important to investigate abuse of public funds, we are still waiting for the Dissanayake government to make a serious effort to ensure accountability for war crimes and rights violations,&quot; she said.</p><p>Mass atrocities committed during Sri Lanka&#x27;s 26-year civil war have gone unpunished, while there is continuing intimidation and surveillance of victims and activists in previously war-affected areas in the north and east.</p><p>Critics of the case against Mr Wickremesinghe say that while he is being targeted, there have been no prosecutions against ex-presidents Gotabaya and Mahinda Rajapaksa, who have been widely blamed for steering Sri Lanka into economic collapse in 2022.</p><h4>Rajapaksas left untouched</h4><p>When Mr Dissanayake and his leftist National People&#x27;s Power (NPP) coalition swept to power last September, they rode a wave of public fury over corruption, austerity, and elite privilege.</p><p>Most of that fury was directed at Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who fled the country after tens of thousands of protesters stormed his home over his mismanagement of the economy.</p><p>&quot;The government hasn&#x27;t gone after [the Rajapaksas] because it doesn&#x27;t want to go to court and lose a case in court [when] it is still collecting conclusive, definitive evidence to be able to convict,&quot; Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu, director of the think tank Centre for Policy Alternatives, told the ABC.</p><p>The Rajapaksas&#x27;s rule was marked by allegations of corruption, debt-fuelled infrastructure projects, and disastrous tax cuts.</p><blockquote><p>&quot;We have to wait and see whether they&#x27;re going to proceed with who the public believes are the real culprits. As far as corruption is concerned, this a step-by-step approach,&quot; Mr Saravanamuttu said.</p></blockquote><p>Sri Lanka is still climbing out of its worst economic crisis in decades.</p><p>Nearly a year on, the Dissanayake government faces the test of translating its rhetoric against corruption into meaningful policy.</p><p>&quot;There is a point at which that anti-corruption drive may become a distraction from not actually doing the things it is supposed to be doing to focus on economic growth,&quot; Mr Saravanamuttu said.</p><h4>Fragile economy in balance</h4><p>If Sri Lanka is to escape the shadow of crisis, analysts say the focus must be not only on arrests, but also on structural change.</p><p>Inflation remains high, debt restructuring is incomplete, and foreign investors are watching carefully, particularly China and India.</p><p>&quot;The media buzz risks distracting the government from doing critical reforms to open the economy to foreign trade and investment, cutting cumbersome red tape and investing in infrastructure,&quot; said Mr Wignaraja, a visiting senior fellow from think-tank ODI Global.</p><p>The International Monetary Fund has tied further aid to reforms that would broaden Sri Lanka&#x27;s tax base, restructure state-owned enterprises, and ensure more fiscal discipline.</p><p>Local analysts say cumbersome bureaucratic processes and slow approvals for setting up small businesses remain major barriers.</p><p>&quot;We need to have ease of doing business that doesn&#x27;t involve five to 10 various authorities before you can actually start a business,&quot; Mr Saravanamuttu said.</p><blockquote><p>&quot;We also need to embrace digital technology and recognise that AI is going to be a major force so we need to start training people to deal with it, and not continue to promise more jobs in public service without thinking of a leaner, more efficient state.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Lasanthika Hettiarachchi, a lawyer at Transparency International Sri Lanka, said Mr Wickremesinghe&#x27;s arrest is not a real turning point for accountability.</p><p>She argues that moment came earlier when the Supreme Court ruled that Gotabaya Rajapaksa and Mahinda Rajapaksa, along with a former finance minister and senior economic officials, had breached public trust through mismanagement.</p><p>&quot;That judgement broke the long-standing impunity of politicians hiding behind policy decisions,&quot; she said.</p><p>What mattered now for investor confidence was whether the rule of law and due process were respected, public finances were managed transparently, and strong oversight institutions were allowed to function independently, she said.</p></div>]]></content:encoded>

          </figure><div><p>Vladimir Putin is determined to continue the bloodshed in Ukraine and has shown no interest in genuine peace talks, a top aide to Volodymyr Zelenskyy has claimed.</p><p>Mykhailo Podolyak, one of the Ukrainian president&#x27;s most senior advisors, has also called on the United States to use more of its &quot;leverage&quot; to force the Kremlin to the negotiating table.</p><p>&quot;They&#x27;re not interested in a meeting between President Zelenskyy and Putin because Russia doesn&#x27;t want the war to end,&quot; he told the ABC in an exclusive interview this week.</p><p>&quot;They don&#x27;t want a ceasefire or any real talks — not even discussions of basic scenarios like freezing the conflict. Russia doesn&#x27;t want any of that.</p><p>&quot;As far as I understand, Putin personally promised Donald Trump in Anchorage to meet but Russia has yet to send a serious, functional, influential delegation. So yes, it&#x27;s possible, but only if Russia is pressured.&quot;</p><p>US President Donald Trump met his Russian counterpart in Alaska on August 15.</p><p>The so-called peace summit is yet to yield any major developments towards stopping the fighting in Ukraine, which has raged since Mr Putin&#x27;s full-scale invasion was launched in February 2022.</p><p>Mr Trump styled the meeting as a major diplomatic breakthrough and flagged the possibility of direct talks between the Russian and Ukrainian leaders in the near future.</p><p>However, the Kremlin&#x27;s veteran foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, has since downplayed the likelihood of that.</p><p>In an interview on US network NBC this week, Mr Lavrov said an &quot;agenda&quot; would need to be finalised and that Mr Putin would only meet with his Ukrainian counterpart if it was agreed Mr Zelenskyy accepted he was the head of a &quot;regime&quot; and not the leader of a sovereign state.</p><p>Mr Podolyak said the request by the Kremlin was a tactic to delay any potential meeting between the pair.</p><p>&quot;It&#x27;s just an excuse not to engage in real negotiations,&quot; he said.</p><p>&quot;Let me be very clear. Russia doesn&#x27;t get to decide the legal status of other countries&#x27; leaders.</p><p>&quot;The Russian Federation has no say in Ukraine&#x27;s internal political matters. The real issue here is Putin&#x27;s fear of real negotiations. He&#x27;s not interested in peace.</p><p>&quot;He wants to keep the war going, to stage fake negotiations with puppet delegates.&quot;</p><p>The calibre of diplomats Russia has sent to talks with Ukraine has raised suspicion about how willing it is to end the war.</p><p>For example, the Kremlin selected former culture minister Vladimir Medinsky to lead its delegation at an Istanbul summit in May. Mr Medinsky has previously denied Ukraine&#x27;s existence and is credited as a key figure behind shaping anti-Kyiv messaging in Russia.</p><p>Mr Podolyak, who has been part of previous Ukrainian delegations that have met with Kremlin representatives, told the ABC that Ukraine would not entertain any discussion around the handing over of territory, even if Russia promised it would end its ground offensive and persistent air attacks.</p><p>Mr Trump has on multiple occasions suggested &quot;land swaps&quot; would be one way for Russia and Ukraine to reach a peace agreement.</p><p>It has since been reported that Mr Putin has suggested Ukraine give Russia control of the entire Donbas region, in exchange for freezing the front lines in their current positions. </p><p>Moscow&#x27;s troops currently occupy about 88 per cent of the Donbas — a region of Ukraine bordering Russia which is rich in minerals.</p><p>&quot;Russia invaded our land,&quot; Mr Podolyak said.</p><p>&quot;What &#x27;exchange&#x27; are we talking about? Trading parts they didn&#x27;t manage to capture after three-and-a-half years of war for other parts they also didn&#x27;t capture?&quot;</p><p>Many defence analysts believe Moscow has realised attempts to claim the Donbas region by force could take years, and cost the country billions of dollars as well as a massive number of casualties.</p><p>The Ukrainian government, including Mr Podolyak, is also convinced that Russia will use the Donbas as a geographic springboard to launch attacks deeper into Ukraine.</p><p>&quot;Russia is the aggressor here,&quot; he said.</p><p>&quot;They want to lock in territorial gains. So let&#x27;s talk about &#x27;compromise&#x27;. What would that mean? That after three-and-a-half years of fierce resistance, we&#x27;re supposed to just hand over Ukrainian territory to the aggressor? Rewarding Russia only encourages more aggression.</p><p>&quot;Why would Russia stop? Why wouldn&#x27;t they see this as profit? If someone breaks into your home and instead of punishment, you give them part of what they wanted -- what makes you think they won&#x27;t come back for more?&quot;</p></div>]]></content:encoded>

or &quot;terrorism&quot;.</p><p>The group is not alone in its mission to silence and punish criticism of Israel — in fact it operates as part of a larger ecosystem.</p><p>However, while many of Australia&#x27;s pro-Israel lobby groups operate discreetly and persistently behind the scenes, Canary Mission wants the world to know exactly what its intentions are.</p><h4>A &#x27;nefarious and McCarthyist enterprise&#x27;</h4><p>As one of the many targets of Canary Mission, Andrew Ross, a professor of Social and Cultural Analysis at New York University (NYU), said the site has been successful in promulgating fear on campuses.</p><p>&quot;No matter what you have achieved in your life, if you&#x27;re publicly critical of Israeli policy you&#x27;re going to be attacked, pulled into disrepute, and efforts will be made to have you either fired from your position or blocked from employment channels,&quot; Professor Ross said.</p><p>His profile on Canary Mission detailed his support of the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions movement (BDS), <a href="https://www.instagram.com/pulseofpal/reel/DDmZSxMKBKi/)">his arrest at NYU</a> after joining a university sit-in, and what was labelled as his &quot;hatred of Israel&quot; — citing his solidarity with student protesters.</p><p>The site&#x27;s tactics have often been compared to McCarthyism in the 1950s — when individuals were targeted, blacklisted, publicly humiliated or lost their jobs if they were deemed to have communist ties or sympathies.</p><p>He said appearing on the &quot;nefarious and McCarthyist enterprise&quot; has amplified harassment and death threats against him and his family.</p><p>&quot;It&#x27;s a doxxing resource … used as ammunition to disparage you, to harass you, to endanger your professional life and worse.&quot;</p><p>While pro-Israel lobbying is not a radically new methodology, Alex Kane — senior reporter at Jewish Currents — said it was the first of its kind and its &quot;poorly sourced&quot; dossiers &quot;ruin people&#x27;s lives&quot;.</p><p>&quot;What made Canary Mission so unique is the leveraging of the internet to create webs of suspicion around people … when all they&#x27;re doing is advocating for the human rights of Palestinians.&quot;</p><p>The site also includes an &quot;ex-canary&quot; ritual, where those who have been profiled can only have their name removed if they appear to repent by writing a public apology.</p><h4>ICE uses Canary Mission to target students</h4><p>The Trump administration&#x27;s crackdown on immigration earlier this year saw hundreds detained and deported.</p><p>In January, Canary Mission targeted student-activist <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-06-21/us-judge-orders-release-of-pro-palestinian-activist-khalil/105445138">Mahmoud Khalil</a>, a negotiator and spokesperson for pro-Palestinian protests at New York&#x27;s Columbia University.</p><p>The lengthy dossier included screenshots of Mr Khalil at protests, several excerpts of slogans he chanted or speeches he made, and his participation in the Columbia University Apartheid Divest student coalition.</p><p>Soon after, far-right Zionist group Betar US <a href="https://x.com/Betar_USA/status/1884796686020550930">posted</a> that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) was aware of his &quot;home address and whereabouts&quot;.</p><p>By March, officers with ICE Homeland Security Investigations arrested Mr Khalil without a warrant.</p><p>That same month, Turkish national <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-28/what-we-know-tufts-university-student-detained-by-ice-agents/105107664">Rumeysa Ozturk</a> — a student at Tufts University in Massachusetts — was detained by six plain-clothes US federal officers.</p><p>It came a year after Canary Mission published the 30-year-old&#x27;s personal details when she co-authored an op-ed in The Tufts Daily calling for the university to divest from companies with ties to Israel.</p><p>Canary Mission <a href="https://x.com/canarymission/status/1905262753264046392">took credit</a> for Ms Ozturk&#x27;s arrest, labelling the dossier &quot;the primary cause&quot;.</p><p>Months later, a federal judge ruled Mr Khalil&#x27;s detention unconstitutional, and Ms Ozturk was released on bail without restrictions after a judge stated there was no evidence presented to support her detention.</p><p>During the trial of the Trump administration&#x27;s deportation policy last month, a senior official within ICE&#x27;s Homeland Security Investigations division confirmed &quot;most&quot; names of student protesters it was asked to investigate were pulled from Canary Mission and Betar US.</p><p>Quincy Institute senior adviser and investigative journalist for Responsible Statecraft, Eli Clifton said Canary Mission&#x27;s relevance and impact has increased since its inception.</p><p>&quot;While there&#x27;s certainly been loads of attempts to stifle free speech in the United States, this is an odd one where actually the goal is to stifle free speech about a country 6,000 miles away and about US foreign policy towards that country,&quot; he said.</p><p>Canary Mission has been contacted for comment.</p><h4>Unprecedented suppression of speech</h4><p>Last year, Heidi Matthews — an assistant professor of law at the Osgoode Hall Law School of York University — found her Canary Mission profile alongside other academics from Canada.</p><p>After working on international criminal law for almost two decades, she said the suppression of speech and academic freedom she was now facing was unprecedented.</p><p>&quot;The purpose is to control public discourse … and to have that conversation only in the terms dictated by the State of Israel,&quot; Professor Matthews said.</p><p>Canary Mission cited her support for the BDS movement and student encampments, and accused her of demonising Israel.</p><p>&quot;Statements I&#x27;ve made have been constructed by Canary Mission as justifying armed resistance that targets civilians, when in fact there&#x27;s just no universe in which any kind of legitimate resistance would encompass that kind of international criminality,&quot; she said.</p><p>Professor Matthews said the site followed the script of other defamatory smear campaigns.</p><p>&quot;I don&#x27;t feel the need to defend myself against organisations who operate emphatically in bad faith, not on the basis of facts and on the basis of very well-funded and organised political motivation,&quot; she said.</p><p>She said academic institutions have failed to support faculty members, including through &quot;scholarship harassment&quot; — when people are targeted for research they do that is incompatible with certain political views.</p><p>Pro-Palestinian students and faculty have also been the target of a plan called Project Esther — launched by conservative Washington-based think tank Heritage Foundation — aimed at suppressing the movement, including protests within schools and universities across the US.</p><p>The think tank is known for spearheading <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-11-16/what-to-know-about-project-2025/104576870">Project 2025</a> — a policy guide for President Donald Trump&#x27;s second term that sought to reshape the federal government.</p><p>In what it said was a plan to fight antisemitism, it branded critics of Israel &quot;a terrorist support network&quot; — calling for them to be deported, sued, expelled and fired.</p><h4>Who is behind the shadowy site?</h4><p>Unlike the people it profiles on its site, Canary Mission has gone to great lengths to keep its own members anonymous.</p><p>Its <a href="https://au.godaddy.com/whois/results.aspx?domain=https%3A%2F%2Fcanarymission.org%2F">web domain</a> shows it uses a proxy company to hide its IP address and ownership.</p><p>While Canary Mission accepts non-tax deductible donations through the site, there is no group by that name registered with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) — the revenue service for the US federal government.</p><p>The site does not appear to have a fiscal sponsor either, which is a nonprofit that helps smaller or unregistered projects accept donations legally and provides financial oversight.</p><p>In 2018, <a href="https://forward.com/news/411355/revealed-canary-mission-blacklist-is-secretly-bankrolled-by-major-jewish/">The Forward</a> reported on a tax filing from a Jewish-American philanthropic organisation showing a $US100,000 donation to the Central Fund of Israel which was designated for &quot;Canary Mission for Megamot Shalom&quot;.</p><p>Megamot Shalom is a mysterious Israeli-based non-profit with minimal online presence, and no spokesperson.</p><p>The Central Fund of Israel facilitates US tax-deductible donations to right-wing Israeli charities and channels money to illegal Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank.</p><p>The Forward also said that a British-born Jerusalem resident was in charge of the site.</p><h4>Expectations &#x27;battle&#x27; will recommence</h4><p>The Israeli government has been contacted for comment.</p><p>A tax <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/203785948/202403349349100505/IRS990PF">document</a> from 2023 showed a Florida-based family foundation gave Canary Mission $US100,000, and listed that it was going to Israel.</p><p>In a report for The Intercept, Eli Clifton found that the treasurer of the Natan and Lidia Peisach Family Foundation — which made the donation — was the husband of University of Pennsylvania trustee Cheryl Peisach.</p><p>Canary Mission has dedicated an entire section of its site to targeting the University of Pennsylvania, its faculty and student body, claiming a &quot;rising tide of antisemitism&quot;.</p><p>Mr Clifton said it shows how &quot;ugly&quot; the debate on college campuses had become — both about Israel and free speech.</p><p>&quot;It&#x27;s pretty inappropriate to have somebody who sits as a trustee of this organisation … funding the very attacks on this institution at a time when the Trump administration is threatening to withhold hundreds of millions of dollars of funding from universities,&quot; Mr Clifton said.</p><p>The University of Pennsylvania, Cheryl Peisach and her husband Jaime have been contacted for comment.</p><p>As US colleges head into the new academic year, Mr Ross said he expects the &quot;battle&quot; to recommence — and he&#x27;s looking forward to the fight.</p><p>&quot;This current generation of students has been so brave and bold,&quot; he said.</p><p>&quot;Even though they&#x27;re being repressed and there&#x27;s a crackdown upon them, they will not stop.&quot;</p></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>Tea is the second-most-popular app in the US and according to the company, it boasts a community of over 4.6 million women sharing and reading stories about people they have dated.</p><p>It is the latest in a long line of online platforms developed for crowdsourcing dating intel.</p><p>From Don&#x27;t Date Him Girl in the mid-late 2000s to Australian-owned social media groups <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-10-14/sis-are-we-dating-the-same-guy-facebook-shutdown-defamation-risk/104467320">Sis, Are We Dating the Same Guy?</a> and <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/listen/programs/radionational-drive/bye-felipe-creator-talks-online-dating/10876974">Bye Felipe</a>.</p><p>But experts warn Tea is escalating this concept to a new level, raising concerns that it deepens gender divides and fosters a culture of surveillance and mistrust.</p><h4>What is Tea?</h4><p>Tea is a US-based app that crowdsources dating experiences, allowing women to flag everything from serious allegations such as abuse or coercion, to more subjective issues such as emotional unavailability or bad communication.</p><p>The app was founded in 2023 but climbed the charts recently, reaching the number one spot in the US in July this year.</p><p>At the time of writing, it is the second-most-popular app in the US (behind only ChatGPT) but has not been rolled out in Australia.</p><p>It attracted more than a million downloads within a week, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kateoflahertyuk/2025/07/24/what-is-tea-the-viral-women-only-app-with-1-million-downloads/">according to Forbes</a>. The company itself boasts a community of more than 4.6 million women who read and post about dating experiences.</p><p>Global Director at men&#x27;s health charity Movember, Zac Seidler, says that while he finds the app &quot;deeply problematic&quot;, he acknowledges that Tea likely began with good intentions.</p><p>&quot;The app was very clearly an attempt at talking about legitimate fears of physical and sexual violence from intimate partners that women and girls face,&quot; he says.</p><p>Evita March, an associate professor at Federation University in Victoria, agreed.</p><p>&quot;Its primary purpose is a fantastic one, to warn women of potential abusers.&quot;</p><p>The TeaOnHer app, on the other hand, emerged this month as a direct retaliation to Tea.</p><p>TeaOnHer is effectively a gender flip of the original app and enables men to anonymously share photos and ratings about women they have dated.</p><p>&quot;It appears the motives for the women&#x27;s app were far more altruistic as they were created with the purpose to help each other, whereas men&#x27;s appear more retaliatory,&quot; says Dr March.</p><p>&quot;There are cases in these groups where men have experienced being the target of false claims and experience slander or defamation,&quot; she adds.</p><p>&quot;In these private groups, men of false claims don&#x27;t have any real way to defend themselves … for many, retaliation when they are feeling hurt and angry seems a legitimate option.&quot;</p><h4>Reputational anxiety in a culture of surveillance</h4><p>What once was private gossip within trusted friend groups has now been scaled and monetised through technology, and the impact is felt deeply.</p><p>Apps like Tea make many young men feel a sense of constant scrutiny and reputational anxiety, said Dr Zac Seidler.</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Many guys are feeling like they&#x27;re constantly on the verge of cancellation and the no due process.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Online masculinity influencers are spreading this idea that &quot;the world is out to get you,&quot; says Dr Seidler.</p><p>Apps like Tea are capitalising on that discontent, &quot;giving them fuel to feel like they&#x27;re being othered&quot;.</p><p>A <a href="https://cdn.sanity.io/files/d6x1mtv1/mo-com-production/e1054b901ac235e16f177a2bca8ee760fb8e6a19.pdf">Movember report</a> found nearly a third of young men engaging with masculinity influencers cited frustrations with women being rude to them or differences in dating values as major sources of discontent.</p><p>A<a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/giwl/assets/iwd-2025-survey.pdf"> global survey</a> also found perceptions of tensions between men and women were highest with younger age groups, with 59 per cent of gen Z reporting so.</p><p>Dr Seidler says the disconnect between young men and women is &quot;being weaponised&quot; by platforms like Tea, contributing to a backlash culture that makes open communication harder.</p><blockquote><p>&quot;It&#x27;s fuelling this gender divide, which is doing nothing but turning men and women against each other.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Dr Seidler warns that this &quot;over-surveillance culture&quot; harms women too.</p><p>He says turning to &quot;crowdsourced intelligence is really frightening&quot; because, instead of helping people develop their own judgement, the app encourages users to &quot;outsource discernment to strangers&quot;.</p><p>&quot;I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re gaining that critical lens about how to judge people accordingly, or how to understand the threshold for what a real red flag is … I think we&#x27;re leaning into this us-versus-them ideology.&quot;</p><p>Ultimately, he argues, platforms like Tea have transformed and &quot;monetised grassroots safety networks&quot; into a form of mass surveillance that has &quot;stripped away any context and accountability&quot;.</p><h4>Lack of moderation and a permanent digital footprint</h4><p>Dr March said one of the most pressing issues with Tea was the absence of moderation and fact-checking.</p><p>&quot;Where things go wrong is, there&#x27;s no way to really determine if this is fact-based,&quot; she says.</p><p>&quot;Although there are real cases of abuse, some claims are subjective to a person&#x27;s experience.&quot;</p><p>Even when content is harmful or false, getting content removed from online spaces is often a slow and arduous process.</p><p>&quot;By the time false claims are removed, there&#x27;s no telling what the consequences are for your character,&quot; she says.</p><p>What makes things worse is that Tea is a women-only app, meaning men are unable to access the app to know if false information is posted about them.</p><p>Dr March highlighted serious concerns about the impact of the digital footprint on minors.</p><p>&quot;These posts … they stay there for somebody who, in the future, could search your name and find that.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Should our behaviour as a minor reflect our personality and character for the rest of our lives?&quot;</p><p>When contacted by the ABC, Tea &quot;politely declined&quot; to comment.</p><h4>Data breach raises privacy concerns</h4><p>This controversy comes as Reuters reported Tea had been the target of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/womens-dating-app-tea-reports-72000-images-stolen-security-breach-2025-07-26/">a major data breach</a> in late July, exposing the personal information of thousands of users.</p><p><a href="https://www.teaforwomen.com/cyberincident">A Tea spokesperson confirmed</a> that hackers accessed more than 72,000 images, including 13,000 selfies and photo identifications submitted for account verification purposes.</p><p>Following the breach, the BBC reportedly found websites, apps and even a &quot;game&quot; featuring the leaked images where men were <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce87rer52k3o">ranking and commenting on the women&#x27;s appearances</a>.</p><p>&quot;This leak was picked up by misogynist communities as a great cause and one that they obviously take a lot of pride in,&quot; Callum Hood, head of research at the Centre for Countering Digital Hate, told the BBC.</p><p>Since the breach, more than 10 women have filed class actions against the company that owns Tea.</p></div>]]></content:encoded>
