That assessment comes from an international monitor known as the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC, which issued a report last month officially declaring famine in the Gaza Governorate for the first time. The assessment comes after months of warnings from the World Food Program, World Health Organization, and other global NGOs stating that Israeli restrictions on food and other basic supplies to the territory were at risk of generating widespread deaths from hunger.</p><p>The Israeli military has vowed to press on with its offensive in Gaza despite global backlash, stating that it plans to force the surviving population of the territory into camps after conquering Gaza City. In the meantime, the humanitarian situation is continuing to deteriorate.</p><p>In response to the famine, some countries have begun airdrops of aid to the territory, with little success.</p><p>This week, Drop Site&#8217;s Murtaza Hussain is joined by <strong>Chris Houston</strong>.

The total recorded death toll since October 7, 2023 is now 63,746 killed and 161,245 injured.</p></li><li><p>Six more deaths, including one child, were recorded over the past 24 hours due to starvation and malnutrition, bringing the total since the start of the war to 367, including 131 children.</p></li><li><p>The Government Media Office in Gaza reports that since the launch of Israel&#8217;s offensive on Gaza City on August 13, Israel has detonated at least 100 robotic vehicles laden with explosives in the streets and conducted more than 70 airstrikes killing 1,100 Palestinians and wounding 6,008.</p></li><li><p>Israeli forces <a href="https://x.com/DropSiteNews/status/1963024880829366386">escalated aerial and artillery strikes</a> across Gaza City&#8212;especially Al-Daraj, Sheikh Radwan, and Zeitoun&#8212;killing at least 53 residents. Prime Minister Netanyahu declared the war had entered its &#8220;decisive stage,&#8221; while Israeli military Chief of Staff Eyal Zamir said ground operations were expanding &#8220;into places we have never entered before&#8221; and the army tightened its encirclement of Gaza City. The military has mobilized 60,000 reservists, with another 20,000 set for extended service.</p></li><li><p>Strikes hit civilians sheltering in multiple areas:</p><ul><li><p>Khan Younis (Al-Mawasi): Drone strike killed 11 people queuing for water, including seven children. Around the same time, the Israeli army spokesman was on X urging Palestinians to relocate there, <a href="https://x.com/DropSiteNews/status/1962903037355196912">pitching it as &#8220;safer&#8221;</a> and with &#8220;better humanitarian services, particularly food and water.&#8221;</p></li><li><p>Al-Daraj: Israeli forces bombed a three-story home, killing at least 11 people, including three children and two women from the Al-Hour and Al-Af families. Civil Defense says seven children remain trapped under the rubble&#8212;one of them a baby just 18 months old.</p></li><li><p>Tel al-Hawa: 16 killed, including three children, in a pre-dawn strike.</p></li><li><p>Journalists: Rasmi Jihad Salem was killed in Gaza City, while Iman Ahmad Al-Zamli was killed in Khan Younis while searching for water.</p></li><li><p>Witnesses reported massive explosions rocking Sheikh Radwan as Israeli forces pressed deeper into the city.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Israeli quadcopters fired incendiary bombs at <a href="https://x.com/DropSiteNews/status/1962983418964131850">two ambulances</a> parked at Sheikh Radwan Clinic, the Civil Defense chief in North Gaza tells Drop Site.</p></li><li><p>The <a href="https://x.com/DropSiteNews/status/1962968402928058768">Palestinian Prisoners&#8217; Club</a> reported today on dire conditions in Israeli prisons, describing starvation, disease outbreaks, medical neglect, and systematic repression. Weekly raids, inadequate food, and denial of medication for chronically ill detainees have led the group to warn of a looming &#8220;health disaster.&#8221; With over 10,800 prisoners, including 450 children, the group called these conditions war crimes requiring urgent international action.</p></li><li><p>The UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities reports that about 40,500 children in Gaza have suffered &#8220;new war-related injuries&#8221; during the war, leaving more than half of them&#8212;or at least 21,000&#8212;disabled.</p></li></ul><h2>Ceasefire Negotiations and Israeli Politics</h2><ul><li><p><a href="https://x.com/DropSiteNews/status/1963004815769743620">Qatari mediators</a> are exploring options to revive indirect talks between Israel and Hamas, but Israel has not responded to a ceasefire proposal that Hamas accepted two weeks ago, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Majed Al Ansari said. He condemned Israel for ignoring diplomatic efforts, continuing military operations, and blocking aid while attempting to &#8220;change the goal posts to fit the Israeli narrative.&#8221; <strong><a href="https://www.dropsitenews.com/p/hamas-israel-gaza-ceasefire-concessions-negotiations-netanyahu-trump">Drop Site&#8217;s Jeremy Scahill and Jawa Ahmad outlined the major concessions offered by Hamas here.</a></strong></p></li><li><p>Israel&#8217;s Strategic Affairs Minister <a href="https://x.com/DropSiteNews/status/1962998168326701257">Ron Dermer</a> privately told Qatari and Egyptian mediators that the government &#8220;does not rule out a partial deal,&#8221; Channel 13 reports, contrasting with Netanyahu&#8217;s public hardline rhetoric. The comments gave mediators cautious optimism about advancing negotiations, though Qatar&#8217;s Foreign Ministry noted that Israel has still not formally responded to the ceasefire proposal Hamas accepted.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://x.com/DropSiteNews/status/1963049547438940656">Haaretz reports</a> that an IDF probe faulted Lt. Col. Haim Cohen, commander of the Gaza Division&#8217;s Northern Brigade, for failing to act on security lapses at the Nova music festival just before the October 7 Hamas attack. Investigators said Cohen ignored prior warnings, saw thousands of attendees with scant police presence, and chose neither to disperse the crowd nor deploy troops&#8212;decisions that left the site exposed. The attack killed 378 people and saw 44 taken captive; Cohen, who had approved the festival&#8217;s security plan days earlier, was later dismissed and retired.</p></li><li><p>Israel is intensifying construction work on a major new structure at a facility that is part of Israel&#8217;s nuclear weapons program, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-dimona-nuclear-weapons-construction-reactor-3f5cbd0aaf25e2c087b881f6352d7de4">according to the Associated Press</a>. Satellite images analyzed by experts told the AP the construction at the Shimon Peres Negev Nuclear Research Center near Dimona could be a new reactor or a facility to assemble nuclear arms.</p></li><li><p>Israeli protesters took to the streets on Wednesday for what has been dubbed a &#8220;day of disruption,&#8221; denouncing the call up of tens of thousands of reservists for the invasion of Gaza City and accusing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his cabinet of failing to secure a ceasefire deal. Israel&#8217;s Army Radio reported the arrest of 13 protesters who climbed onto the roof of the National Library in Jerusalem.</p></li></ul><h2>West Bank</h2><ul><li><p>Hamas condemned Israel&#8217;s plan to create a &#8220;Hebron Emirate&#8221; following the arrest of its mayor Tayseer Abu Sneineh; Netanyahu and senior ministers have proposed to carve Hebron out of the Palestinian Authority and place it under Israel-aligned leadership. Hamas compared it to the <a href="https://x.com/DropSiteNews/status/1962979784385761649">failed Village Leagues</a> of the late 1970s and early 1980s. Those Israel-backed, clan-based local councils aimed to weaken the PLO by promoting compliant rural leadership but collapsed amid widespread resistance and rejection.</p></li><li><p>A video showing young Palestinian boy Imran Shahin being blindfolded and detained by Israeli soldiers in Nablus went viral last week. Shahin recounted being shot at, beaten, tied up, and taken to Huwara camp, where the abuse continued, <a href="https://x.com/DropSiteNews/status/1962987873923432931">telling news outlet Sahat</a>, &#8220;May God help the children of Gaza&#8230;and the prisoners too.&#8221;</p></li><li><p>The Jerusalem Governorate&#8217;s August 2025 report documents <a href="https://x.com/DropSiteNews/status/1962936882330837130">widespread Israeli violations</a>, including 30 home demolitions (12 forced by families), 93 eviction orders, and 32 arrests&#8212;four of them children&#8212;plus administrative detention, house arrest, and travel bans. Al-Aqsa Mosque saw 8,617 settlers storm its courtyards under military protection, including nearly 4,000 on &#8220;Destruction of the Temple&#8221; day performing rituals that violate the status quo. Settler violence surged with 59 attacks, 25 injuries, and 17 settlement plans advanced, including the contentious E1 project threatening Palestinian territorial continuity.</p></li></ul><h2>U.S. News</h2><ul><li><p>Trump announced Tuesday the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/09/02/nx-s1-5525984/venezuela-trump-drugs-caribbean">Navy hit a boat departing Venezuela</a> that Washington claimed was linked to drug trafficking, calling it a &#8220;precision strike&#8221; on a &#8220;narco-terrorist&#8221; group. Critics slammed the attack as illegal under international law, noting traffickers should be arrested, not executed. The move comes amid an expanded U.S. naval presence in the Caribbean. Declassified intelligence and independent investigations have found no evidence of Maduro or senior officials directing Tren de Aragua or a so-called &#8220;Cartel de los Soles.&#8221; Secretary of State Marco Rubio <a href="https://x.com/marcorubio/status/1962992360822104110">posted</a> an unclassified video of the strike.</p></li><li><p>A federal appeals court ruled on Tuesday that Trump cannot use the 18th-century wartime Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans suspected of being gang members. In a 2-1 ruling, the judges granted a preliminary injunction because they &#8220;found no invasion or predatory incursion&#8221; in this case.</p></li><li><p>Trump said Tuesday he will send <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-chicago-baltimore-law-enforcement-6d7c80258f17c3d679358467531f7e9d">federal authorities into Chicago</a> and Baltimore to fight crime, despite opposition from local and state leaders who warned the move is unwanted, unnecessary, and likely unconstitutional. A federal judge made a similar assessment, ruling yesterday that Trump&#8217;s use of the National Guard in L.A. as a federal police force is illegal.</p></li></ul><h2>International News</h2><ul><li><p><a href="https://x.com/DropSiteNews/status/1962945380783415634">Yemen&#8217;s Ansarallah</a> said it launched four coordinated retaliatory strikes on Tuesday after Israel assassinated Houthi Prime Minister Ahmed al-Rahawi and other ministers. It claimed targets included the Israeli military&#8217;s General Staff headquarters in Tel Aviv, the Hadera power plant, Ben Gurion Airport, Ashdod Port, and an Israeli-linked container ship in the Red Sea. Israel has not confirmed any impacts, though Netanyahu&#8217;s cabinet met in a fortified site.

Yet children and babies are unable to get proper treatment at Al-Rantisi due to massive overcrowding, severe shortages of medical supplies, and a widening famine as a result of the Israeli blockade.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!oCD4!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7c893aa3-6811-47af-a17c-87d8b6c4c361_3018x1700.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!oCD4!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7c893aa3-6811-47af-a17c-87d8b6c4c361_3018x1700.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!oCD4!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7c893aa3-6811-47af-a17c-87d8b6c4c361_3018x1700.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!oCD4!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7c893aa3-6811-47af-a17c-87d8b6c4c361_3018x1700.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!oCD4!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7c893aa3-6811-47af-a17c-87d8b6c4c361_3018x1700.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!oCD4!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7c893aa3-6811-47af-a17c-87d8b6c4c361_3018x1700.png" width="1456" height="820" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7c893aa3-6811-47af-a17c-87d8b6c4c361_3018x1700.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:820,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:6432057,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.dropsitenews.com/i/172612789?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7c893aa3-6811-47af-a17c-87d8b6c4c361_3018x1700.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!oCD4!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7c893aa3-6811-47af-a17c-87d8b6c4c361_3018x1700.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!oCD4!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7c893aa3-6811-47af-a17c-87d8b6c4c361_3018x1700.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!oCD4!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7c893aa3-6811-47af-a17c-87d8b6c4c361_3018x1700.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!oCD4!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7c893aa3-6811-47af-a17c-87d8b6c4c361_3018x1700.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Umm Issa Abu Daf with her son, Adham inside Al-Rantisi Children&#8217;s Hospital in Gaza City on August 26, 2025.

They easily get fevers and get sick. But all praise be to God, what else can we do? I&#8217;m supposed to be on a hospital bed, and my child should be in a safe, clean place, getting proper treatment. But here I am, on the floor, with no place to sit,&#8221; Umm Issa said. &#8220;The children are deprived of everything. No diapers, no formula, no proper treatment. Even food, if I want to feed them anything, there&#8217;s nothing. I can barely manage.&#8221;</p><p>Children are particularly vulnerable to Israel&#8217;s starvation campaign in Gaza, which reached a tipping point this summer with Palestinians dying of hunger every day. A total of 361 Palestinians have died of hunger since the start of the war, 130 of them children, according to Gaza&#8217;s health ministry. At least 185 of those starvation deaths have come in August alone. Some 43,000 children under five are now suffering from malnutrition, according to the health ministry, as Israel has severely restricted the amount of food and aid allowed into the enclave.</p><p>&#8220;This is the only hospital still providing pediatric medical care, after several other hospitals&#8212;like Al-Durra Hospital, Al-Nasr Hospital, Kamal Adwan Hospital, the Indonesian Hospital, and Beit Hanoun Hospital&#8212;have all been put out of service,&#8221; Dr. Mohammad Madi, the head of the Pediatrics Department at Al-Rantisi, told Drop Site. &#8220;Now only Rantisi Children&#8217;s Hospital remains. It is the only hospital providing medical care for children.&#8221;</p><div class="native-video-embed" data-component-name="VideoPlaceholder" data-attrs="{&quot;mediaUploadId&quot;:&quot;fddd605b-1f0a-4acc-8044-b8410579df0b&quot;,&quot;duration&quot;:null}"></div><p><em>Scenes from inside Al-Rantisi Children&#8217;s Hospital in Gaza City on August 26, 2025. (Video by Abdel Qader Sabbah.)</em></p><p>&#8220;This has caused a massive overflow and overcrowding of children in our hospital and its departments. The bed capacity in the unit I&#8217;m working in at Rantisi Hospital is 30 beds. Unfortunately, we currently have 90 cases in this unit. This means we are operating at 300% capacity, which greatly reduces the quality of care that each child can receive because of the congestion. We know that overcrowding leads to the spread of diseases&#8212;so imagine what it means for sick children and the level of overcrowding we have here,&#8221; he added.</p><p>Like other hospitals still functioning in Gaza, Al-Rantisi is suffering from a shortage of supplies and medicine.</p><p>&#8220;For example, in dermatological conditions, we have no ointments or specific medications available at all. It&#8217;s very difficult for us,&#8221; Dr. Madi said. &#8220;A lot of medications are needed for chronic diseases as well. Chronic diseases such as kidney diseases or those needing biological treatments&#8212;like the drug MabThera [used to treat certain autoimmune diseases]&#8212;are not available to us. We&#8217;re forced to use alternatives, and these alternatives simply don&#8217;t suffice.&#8221;</p><p>The overcrowding has also led to &#8220;severe exhaustion and fatigue&#8221; among the medical staff, Dr. Madi said. Nurses, who should be overseeing 6 to 10 patients, find themselves responsible for 25 children in a single ward. &#8220;This results in physical exhaustion and psychological stress for the healthcare workers here in Gaza City,&#8221; Dr. Madi added. &#8220;The medical teams are exhausted. The children are not receiving the level of care they need.&#8221;</p><p>The lack of available medical staff is plainly visible inside Al-Rantisi.

From experience, we&#8217;ve learned how to handle some of the basics ourselves, because we always find ourselves coming back to this hospital with our children. And, of course, may God give the medical staff strength,&#8221; Al-Ladawi told Drop Site. &#8220;Here&#8217;s a simple example: the nebulizer. Each child should have their own device, since these are contagious viral diseases. But at the hospital, they use the same nebulizer for multiple children. An entire department might only have three nebulizer devices. This increases the spread of disease. There&#8217;s no medical equipment, no medicine, and diseases are spreading rapidly.&#8221; Humanitarian organizations have warned of a growing epidemic of highly contagious skin infections in Gaza as a result of lack of clean water, poor sanitation and medical care, with children being the worst affected by bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites, including outbreaks of scabies, lice, and Bullous Impetigo.</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.dropsitenews.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Drop Site News is reader-supported.

He had severe pneumonia and fluid in his lungs, caused by the war we are going through. He also suffers from severe malnutrition. Right now, he&#8217;s five months old, but he only weighs 4.5 kilograms [9.9 pounds] &#8212;the weight of a one-month-old baby. He also has valve enlargement and bladder problems. All of this is because of the war.&#8221;</p><p>According to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), one in five babies in Gaza is born prematurely or underweight and one in seven newborns is in need of emergency neonatal care because of severe complications. UNFPA called the famine in Gaza &#8220;a possible death sentence&#8221; for pregnant and breastfeeding women and their newborns. &#8220;For mothers in Gaza, [famine] means being forced to give birth while malnourished, exhausted and at heightened risk of death. It means their babies are born too small, too weak or too early to survive. It means mothers unable to breastfeed because they, too, are starving,&#8221; UNFPA said in a statement. &#8220;The children who survive will be marked by lasting scars: stunting, developmental delays, weakened immunity, and increased risk of chronic disease in adulthood.&#8221;</p><p>Lara Al-Batran stood next to her ailing daughter, one of the few able to have a hospital bed. Suffering respiratory complications, a plastic breathing tube protruded from her throat. &#8220;We rushed her to the hospital as she was in critical condition&#8212;a one-way trip, with no return home. They inserted a chest tube for breathing. She stayed in that condition for 50 days, and her situation kept deteriorating, alongside malnutrition,&#8221; Al-Batran told Drop Site. &#8220;The hospital does whatever it can. But honestly, there are delays, they take a long time with us because of the number of cases they&#8217;re dealing with.

The death toll since the beginning of the war has now topped 63,600 Palestinians, including over 18,000 children, according to the Gaza health ministry&#8217;s official tally, which is widely seen as a vast undercount. Nearly 161,000 have been injured.</p><p>The 11 hospitals still functioning in Gaza City represent approximately 50% of all in-patient and ICU beds in the Gaza Strip. As Israel moves ahead with its plans to invade, seize control of, and ethnically cleanse Gaza City, the enclave stands to lose half of its hospital bed capacity, according to the WHO, creating even more catastrophic conditions for Palestinians in need of medical care, including the children at Al-Rantisi.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!jj9Q!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe60e15e2-fc7e-49eb-a035-da9747ec3e64_3016x1706.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!jj9Q!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe60e15e2-fc7e-49eb-a035-da9747ec3e64_3016x1706.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!jj9Q!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe60e15e2-fc7e-49eb-a035-da9747ec3e64_3016x1706.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!jj9Q!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe60e15e2-fc7e-49eb-a035-da9747ec3e64_3016x1706.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!jj9Q!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe60e15e2-fc7e-49eb-a035-da9747ec3e64_3016x1706.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!jj9Q!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe60e15e2-fc7e-49eb-a035-da9747ec3e64_3016x1706.png" width="1456" height="824" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e60e15e2-fc7e-49eb-a035-da9747ec3e64_3016x1706.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:824,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:6801832,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.dropsitenews.com/i/172612789?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe60e15e2-fc7e-49eb-a035-da9747ec3e64_3016x1706.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!jj9Q!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe60e15e2-fc7e-49eb-a035-da9747ec3e64_3016x1706.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!jj9Q!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe60e15e2-fc7e-49eb-a035-da9747ec3e64_3016x1706.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!jj9Q!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe60e15e2-fc7e-49eb-a035-da9747ec3e64_3016x1706.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!jj9Q!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe60e15e2-fc7e-49eb-a035-da9747ec3e64_3016x1706.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Iman Al-Kafarna with her baby daughter in Al-Rantisi Children&#8217;s Hospital in Gaza City on August 26, 2025.

In the al-Mawasi area of southern Gaza, eleven people were killed, including seven children, in an Israeli airstrike that hit people queuing for water.</p></li><li><p>Gaza&#8217;s Ministry of Health reports at least 76 Palestinians killed and 281 injured in the past 24 hours. Twelve Palestinians were killed and 90 injured while seeking aid. The total recorded death toll since October 7, 2023 is now 63,633 killed and 160,914 injured.</p></li><li><p>Thirteen more deaths, including three children, were recorded over the past 24 hours due to starvation and malnutrition, bringing the total since the start of the war to 361, including 130 children. At least 185 Palestinians died from hunger in August alone. Gaza&#8217;s Health Ministry reports that <a href="https://x.com/DropSiteNews/status/1962791966384504947">43,000 children under five</a> are suffering from malnutrition as the flow of food and aid remains largely blocked.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://x.com/DropSiteNews/status/1962655980753223880">UN OCHA reports</a> at least 86.5% of Gaza is under displacement orders or militarized zones as of August 31. Between August 27 and 31, at least 23,319 displacement movements were recorded, mostly from Gaza City to southern neighborhoods like Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis. Since Israel broke the ceasefire in March, over 856,000 displacement movements have been tracked, though these figures reflect movements rather than individual people, as many families displace multiple times.</p></li><li><p>Israel is mobilizing tens of thousands of reservists on Tuesday as part of its plan to invade and ethnically cleanse Gaza City. Last month, the Israeli military announced at least 60,000 reservists would be gradually called up. It will also extend the service of 20,000 reservists already on duty.</p></li><li><p>Fires broke out in the <a href="https://x.com/DropSiteNews/status/1962645288142667964">Sheikh Radwan market</a>, north of Gaza City, after Israeli drones dropped incendiary bombs on tents housing displaced Palestinians, causing widespread damage. Israel is also reportedly using <a href="https://x.com/DropSiteNews/status/1962285549013565856">explosive-laden robots</a> to force displacement in Gaza City. Gaza relief official Eyad Amawi says these tactics&#8212;targeting residential areas and entrances&#8212;spread terror and drive civilians to flee.</p></li><li><p>The number of journalists killed by Israel in Gaza is now at least 247 following the death of Islam Abed, a correspondent with al-Quds Today TV who was killed in an Israeli airstrike on Gaza City. The office condemned Israel&#8217;s systematic targeting of Palestinian reporters and called on press institutions to speak out. The Palestinian Journalists Syndicate labeled the attacks a war crime, calling it &#8220;a stain that will haunt the killers of truth.&#8221;</p></li><li><p>Israeli forces opened fire near journalists in Gaza City&#8217;s Sheikh Radwan neighborhood, captured in footage by reporter <a href="https://x.com/DropSiteNews/status/1962589472756781503">Hani Abu Rizq</a>.</p></li><li><p>Channel 12 reports that Israeli officials are considering expanding support for <a href="https://x.com/DropSiteNews/status/1962519194471121286">Yasser Abu Shabab&#8217;s</a> armed gang in southern Gaza, which a security source told Channel 12 &#8220;saved the lives of many of our soldiers.&#8221; This comes as the Israeli military prepares to invade Gaza City and forcibly displace roughly 1 million residents south into restricted zones. Israel claims to be providing water, aid trucks, and family tents, but Gaza officials and recent UN updates dispute these figures.</p></li><li><p>Lawyer visits reveal that <a href="https://x.com/DropSiteNews/status/1962513042207314126">Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya</a>, director of Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza, and his nephew are being held in Ofer Prison and are suffering from dire conditions, including minimal sunlight, severe skin infections, and extreme weight loss. Dr. Abu Safiya emphasized his continued commitment to providing medical treatment for the people of Gaza: &#8220;We will remain on our land and continue to provide healthcare services to the people, God willing, even from a tent.&#8221;</p></li><li><p>The <a href="https://x.com/DropSiteNews/status/1962477948075708656">International Association of Genocide Scholars</a> overwhelmingly passed a resolution stating that Israel&#8217;s actions in Gaza meet the legal definition of genocide under Article II of the 1948 UN Genocide Convention, with 86% of voting members supporting the declaration.</p></li><li><p>Israeli warplanes bombed tents sheltering displaced people inside <a href="https://x.com/DropSiteNews/status/1962290584862814305">Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital </a>in central Gaza, next to the outpatient clinic. The strike injured at least two people, officials said, caused material damage, and posed a grave threat to dozens of patients at the facility.</p></li><li><p>A leaked IDF assessment admits that &#8220;Gideon&#8217;s Chariots,&#8221; the May Gaza offensive, <a href="https://x.com/DropSiteNews/status/1962250573505298828">failed to defeat Hamas</a>, return captives, or maintain Israel&#8217;s military and political objectives. The report notes that the campaign drained forces and damaged international legitimacy. The leak comes as Israel launches &#8220;Gideon&#8217;s Chariots II,&#8221; a massive offensive targeting the over 1 million residents of Gaza City and surrounding camps.</p></li><li><p>Gaza&#8217;s Government Media Office reports a widespread outbreak of a <a href="https://x.com/DropSiteNews/status/1962145024734339127">new influenza strain</a>, disproportionately affecting displaced families, children, and the elderly. Overcrowding, collapsed health services, and the blockade have left thousands without treatment amid critical shortages of medicine and staff.</p></li><li><p>The bodies of at least sixteen Palestinian have been gathered following the latest Israeli airstrike on a residential building near <a href="https://x.com/DropSiteNews/status/1962678648420606344">Al-Wahda Stadium.</a></p></li></ul><h2>West Bank</h2><ul><li><p>Israeli forces arrested at least 25 Palestinians across the occupied West Bank in dawn raids today, according to the Palestinian Prisoners' Media Office. The raids took place in numerous locations, with at least 13 of the arrests in the northern governorate of Nablus. Among those arrested on Tuesday was the mayor of Hebron, Tayseer Abu Sneine, who was detained after Israeli forces ransacked his home.</p></li><li><p>Israel&#8217;s government is considering <a href="https://x.com/DropSiteNews/status/1962333767743250861">annexing parts of the West Bank</a> following European recognition of Palestine, with options ranging from 10% of the territory to all of &#8220;Area C.&#8221; Far-right Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich has called for significant steps, while U.S. officials have reportedly told Israel the decision is &#8220;in Israel&#8217;s hands.&#8221; International law deems annexation of occupied territory a war crime, with European governments warning of sanctions and Arab experts cautioning it could derail peace and normalization efforts.</p></li></ul><h2>U.S. News</h2><ul><li><p><a href="https://x.com/DropSiteNews/status/1962669286289277260">Trump commented</a> on Israel&#8217;s war in Gaza, saying: &#8220;They may be winning the war, but they&#8217;re not winning the world of public relations.&#8221; In an interview with the Daily Caller, he noted declining U.S. political support for Israel, blaming progressive lawmakers for shifting the debate, while also claiming: &#8220;Nobody has done more for Israel than I have&#8221; and referencing the October 7 attacks. He highlighted a generational shift in opinion and a weakening of Israel&#8217;s influence in Congress compared with 20 years ago.</p></li><li><p>ICE reactivated its $2 million contract with Paragon Solutions, the Israeli spyware company, which had been paused because of an executive order issued under the Biden administration to limit U.S. procurement of foreign spyware. Paragon was subsequently purchased by U.S. private equity firm and merged with a Virginia cybersecurity company and the contract was reactivated, <a href="https://jackpoulson.substack.com/p/exclusive-ice-has-reactivated-its">Jack Poulson reports</a>.</p></li><li><p>The Washington Post reports that the Trump administration is circulating a postwar plan for Gaza that includes proposals to ethnically cleanse the enclave. In this plan, Gaza would be placed under a U.S.-run trusteeship for at least a decade, with Palestinians either &#8220;voluntarily&#8221; relocated abroad or confined to &#8220;secure zones&#8221; during reconstruction. Drop Site contributor <a href="https://x.com/DropSiteNews/status/1940594509680672843">Rhana Natour</a> explains how the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) played a significant role in shaping the proposal.</p></li><li><p>The Trump administration suspended U.S. visitor visas for <a href="https://x.com/DropSiteNews/status/1962272206781637079">all Palestinian passport holders</a>, according to the New York Times. The policy halts travel for medical treatment, education, family visits, and business, affecting Palestinians not only in Gaza but also in the West Bank and across the diaspora.</p></li></ul><h2>International News</h2><ul><li><p>The Delhi High Court rejected bail for <a href="https://x.com/DropSiteNews/status/1962817505677713423">nine Muslim activists</a>, including Umar Khalid, a well-known human rights advocate imprisoned since 2020. Authorities accuse them of instigating the 2020 Delhi riots, though rights groups argue the charges are politically motivated and lack evidence. Critics say their detention reflects the Modi government&#8217;s targeting of dissent.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>The death toll from a 6.0-magnitude earthquake that struck eastern <a href="https://x.com/DropSiteNews/status/1962533144789205268">Afghanistan&#8217;s Nangarhar Province</a> on Sunday, has topped 1,400 with more than 3,000 injured. Rescue efforts have been slowed by blocked roads, landslides, and heavy rain, though helicopters and military flights evacuated dozens and transported hundreds of casualties. Taliban spokesperson Sohail Shaheen urged international organizations to provide aid, warning that many villages remain inaccessible and casualties may rise.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro announced that his country was at &#8220;maximum preparedness&#8221; in the face of increasing threats by the U.S. government, including the deployment of a growing number of naval assets in the region and personal threats targeting him and other senior officials in his government. The U.S. Navy has deployed several warships in Latin America in recent weeks as part of an expanding military presence believed to be aimed at the Venezuelan government, as well as drug cartels operating in the region. Announcing the possibility of a national military mobilization, Maduro denounced the deployment as, &#8220;an extravagant, unjustifiable, immoral and absolutely criminal and bloody threat.&#8221;</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>A landslide in Sudan's Darfur region wiped out an entire village and killed more than 1,000 people on Sunday, according to the Sudan Liberation Movement's, in one of the deadliest natural disasters in Sudan&#8217;s recent history. The landslide destroyed the village of Tarasin in Central Darfur&#8217;s Marrah Mountains after days of heavy rainfall.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>The <a href="https://x.com/DropSiteNews/status/1962804647929717194">Global Sumud Flotilla</a> reported that five smaller vessels turned back due to rough weather, but all passengers are safe and 19 ships continue toward Gaza. Organizers emphasized the mission&#8217;s resilience, framing it as a civilian effort to break Israel&#8217;s blockade where governments have failed. The convoy, which set sail from Barcelona on September 1, includes the 107-year-old Sirius carrying 28 people as part of the ongoing humanitarian voyage. <strong>Drop Site editor Alex Colston is on board and will be reporting live as it sails from Barcelona toward Gaza.</strong></p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Thousands gathered at Shaab Mosque in the Yemeni capital of Sanaa on Monday for the funerals of the prime minister of Yemen's Houthi-run government Ahmad Ghaleb al-Rahwi and 11 other Houthi leaders in an Israeli airstrike last week. Al-Rahawi was the most senior Houthi official to be killed since an Israeli-U.S. campaign against the Houthis began earlier this year.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Starting tomorrow, Israeli bonds will no longer <a href="https://x.com/DropSiteNews/status/1962632060557738040">be sold in Ireland</a>, ending the country&#8217;s role as Israel&#8217;s EU &#8220;home member state&#8221; for bond approvals. Since October 7, Israel has raised over $5.5 billion through these bonds, with Ireland&#8217;s system alone contributing an estimated $110&#8211;140 million.</p></li><li><p>At the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit in Tianjin, <a href="https://x.com/DropSiteNews/status/1962359032645050778">India, China, and Russia signaled closer alignment </a>amid U.S. tariffs and sanctions.

His youngest son, who has Down syndrome, was suffering breathing difficulties; his wife carried him through the night toward hospitals, guided only by the light of bombs falling around them, he told Drop Site. Al-Nuri recalled how his daughter explained the way they found the route: &#8220;Don&#8217;t people say all roads lead to Rome?

Israeli officials have tied a possible withdrawal from their occupying positions on Lebanese territory to the initiative, while Saudi Arabia and Qatar have pledged investment in a southern Lebanon economic zone aimed at rebuilding war-damaged areas.</p><p>Residents of southern Lebanese villages say their opposition to the plan to disarm Hezbollah stems from the Lebanese government&#8217;s failure to respond to over 3,000 Israeli ceasefire violations since November 2024. These include drone strikes, airstrikes, sniper fire, and the ongoing occupation of Lebanese territory. Villages under the Israeli hilltop positions face near-daily attacks.</p><p>The southern Lebanese town of Kfarchouba was heavily bombarded and occupied by Israeli forces until late last year. The mosque, school, and the Kfarchouba town square were reduced to rubble, along with roughly 120 homes. </p><p>Residents are living in what remains of the town and are under constant surveillance and targeting from the nearby Israeli troops&#8212;exposed to attacks despite the declared ceasefire. One man said he was shot at while repairing his rooftop water tank. Another described how her brother was killed by a drone strike while tending to his chicken farm.</p><p>Farmer Ismael Nasser&#8217;s defiance of an Israeli bulldozer in June 2023 went viral. Nasser told Drop Site that after October 8, 2023, when support for Palestine began from Lebanon, his home was the first to be bombed.</p><p>Journalist Jeremy Loffredo reports for Drop Site News.</p><p><em>We have a commitment to ensuring that our journalism is not locked behind a paywall.

August 28, 2025. (Photo by Rasha Abu Jalal)</figcaption></figure></div><p>GAZA CITY&#8212;We refuse to move south. We have made our decision. </p><p>Like so many other Palestinians in Gaza, I have ended up in a tent&#8212;the enduring symbol of displacement. I am camped out on the rubble with my husband and five children in western Gaza City. The merciless Israeli military machine is bearing down on us, getting closer every day and there is nothing we can do. But we won&#8217;t leave here.</p><p>Not long ago, we were living in my friend&#8217;s house in northern Gaza City. Our home was destroyed by Israel a few weeks into the war, in early November 2023. My friend fled to Egypt in December 2023.</p><p>But earlier this month, the Israeli military began to implement Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu&#8217;s plan to invade, seize, and ethnically cleanse Gaza City and force over a million Palestinians southward. On August 19, as the bombs and shells rained down and the tanks and troops approached, we were forced to leave my friend&#8217;s house and move into this tent that my husband set up on the ruins of our destroyed home in western Gaza City.</p><div class="image-gallery-embed" data-attrs="{&quot;gallery&quot;:{&quot;images&quot;:[{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/87501862-175a-45ea-bacc-3dfce308b60b_4624x2608.jpeg&quot;},{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d07965b6-d3d7-4bed-ac6e-8c6a17eb9851_4624x2608.jpeg&quot;},{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9b4552d2-7064-421f-b6ec-5f34de242109_4624x2608.jpeg&quot;},{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/14fe99f1-e7f9-41d9-91c3-e3875d9e5fa4_4624x2608.jpeg&quot;}],&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;Clockwise from top left: (1) Rasha Abu Jalal's children stand in front of their tent on August 20, 2025 in Gaza City.

We were forced from our home in October 2023, after Netanyahu ordered all Palestinians to displace to the south a few days after the war began. Like hundreds of thousands of others, we were only able to return to the north after the January 2025 ceasefire agreement. That ceasefire only lasted until March 2025, when Israel broke it and resumed its scorched earth campaign.</p><p>Our experience in the south will never fade from my memory. We never knew any kind of stability. We were forced to move no less than 13 times between different neighborhoods and cities&#8212;fleeing bombardment, or searching for water, or privacy, or a semblance of life in overcrowded shelters.</p><p>Our decision not to go south again was not driven by courage as much as it was by a refusal to repeat this tragedy. Do you know that feeling when you&#8217;re stuck between two non-choices? To either stay where you are without knowing what will happen, or to leave for another place without knowing what awaits you?</p><p>At night, violent explosions from the eastern and northern areas of Gaza City thunder through the darkness, especially in the neighborhoods of Jabaliya, Al-Saftawi, and Abu Iskandar, just a few kilometers away from me, now emptied of residents.</p><p>The aim of the Israeli army in these residential areas is not just to invade and occupy them, but to systematically destroy them.</p><p>The army deploys robotic vehicles loaded with explosives into the heart of residential blocks and detonates them, causing massive destruction. Then they go to another neighborhood and do the same thing. Killing anyone who remains there. Their goal is to erase Gaza City entirely through this method.</p><p>I feel that our neighborhood&#8217;s turn is coming soon. Our neighborhood where we now live in a tent on the ruins of our home along with thousands of others who fled their homes in areas of the city to the east and to the north.</p><p>The explosive-laden robots are not even the most frightening thing. There are the quadcopters&#8212;small, unmanned aircraft that are armed with bombs and bullets and remotely controlled by Israeli soldiers.</p><p>The quadcopters fill the skies everywhere in Gaza. They fire at displaced people and drop bombs on the rooftops of houses where families are still sheltering, forcing them to flee.</p><p>We decided to stay in Gaza City, but I really don&#8217;t know how long this decision will last. As the Israeli army draws closer and closer from the east, I feel that our escape to the south might only be a matter of time.</p><p>It is a mistake to believe that the south is safer than the north. Just a couple of days ago, a husband and wife who had fled Gaza City to the Nuseirat refugee camp were killed in an Israeli airstrike. The Israelis also killed my colleague, journalist Hassan Douhan, who worked for the newspaper <em>A</em>l-Hayat Al-Jadida, fatally shooting him on August 25 while he was inside his tent in the Mawasi area of Khan Younis. That same day, also in Khan Younis, they bombed Nasser hospital twice, killing 22 people, including five journalists.</p><p>My 13-year-old daughter Saida asked me: &#8220;Can we return to Gaza City if we are displaced south once more?&#8221;</p><p>I had no answer.</p><p>What drives many people here to stay and refuse displacement is the feeling that if they leave this city, they will be expelled from the Gaza Strip forever.</p><p>A few minutes after my daughter asked me this, I received a call from the sister of my friend whose house I had recently been living in. She asked if she and her family of four could come and stay in our tent.</p><p>This 16-meter-square tent cannot possibly accommodate two families&#8212;a total of 11 people&#8212;but I could not refuse her. I felt I owed it to my friend, who once gave me her home to live in, to host her sister in return.</p><p>My husband, shocked by my lack of objection, asked me, &#8220;Where will they live? Where will they sleep? How will this tent hold out?&#8221; Again, I had no answer and stayed silent.</p><p>There is an acute shortage of tents in Gaza City. Most displaced people do not even have one, and Israel falsely <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/israel-to-resume-supply-of-tents-shelter-equipment-to-gaza-ahead-of-expanded-op/">claims</a> it is flooding Gaza with tents.</p><p>The price of a tent has reached about $900. It cost no more than $70 just a few weeks ago.</p><p>Everything here has become insane.</p><p>Soon afterward, my friend&#8217;s sister called again and told me she would not be coming after all. Her family had decided to flee south instead of staying in Gaza City. She told me: &#8220;You should think like us. They will destroy what remains of the city.&#8221;</p><p>Dozens of displaced families continue to arrive in the western neighborhoods of Gaza City, fleeing the Israeli invasion.</p><p>My neighbor&#8212;someone I recently met who now lives in the tent next to mine&#8212;asked me, &#8220;Will we stay here or will we move south?&#8221; She expected me to give her an answer rooted in reality since I am a journalist following events closely.</p><p>I tried to reassure her. I told her, I didn&#8217;t think the Israeli invasion would reach the western neighborhoods where we were. That this invasion was just to pressure Hamas at the negotiation table to accept Israel&#8217;s conditions to end the war, the most important being disarming Hamas and ending its presence in Gaza.</p><p>I think Israel is using Palestinian civilians as bargaining chips and political pressure tools to achieve what it cannot achieve militarily.</p><p>In March 2025, Israel imposed a famine on the people of Gaza by preventing the entry of all food and aid in order to force Hamas into submission. To date, 322 Palestinians, including 121 children, have died from Israel&#8217;s starvation policies. Meanwhile, ceasefire negotiations remain stalled.</p><p>Although Israel decided at the end of May to reopen the crossings and allow a meager amount of aid trucks into Gaza, the aid does not reach the population. People are shot by Israeli soldiers every day trying to get food. Or armed gangs loot the trucks, which are left without any protection as the Israeli military deliberately targets any protective units provided by the clans or Hamas security forces.</p><p>These gangs then sell the stolen food in local markets at exorbitant prices that far exceed the purchasing power of most families, who have lost their sources of income during the war and now depend almost entirely on humanitarian aid.</p><p>In the face of all these dilemmas, and the pressing question of whether to remain in Gaza City or flee south again, I feel lost in a vast maze, unable to find any way out.</p><p>I no longer have the strength to make the right decisions. There are no right decisions to make. I have surrendered to an unknown fate.</p><p><em>*This article was amended to correct the date of the ceasefire and Israel resuming the war from January 2024 and March 2024 to January 2025 and March

The ministry reports at least 59 Palestinians killed and 224 injured in the past 24 hours. Twenty-three Palestinians were killed and 182 injured while seeking aid. The total recorded death toll since October 7, 2023 is now 63,025 killed and 159,490 injured.</p></li><li><p>Five more deaths were recorded due to starvation and malnutrition, bringing the total to 322 deaths, including 121 children.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>At least 51 Palestinians have been killed across Gaza since dawn today, including at least seven seeking aid, according to Al Jazeera. Many were killed in the south in al-Mawasi&#8212;a so-called &#8220;humanitarian zone&#8221; designated by Israel.</p></li><li><p>Israel has declared Gaza City &#8220;a dangerous combat zone&#8221; as it continues to escalate its attack on the Gaza Strip&#8217;s largest city, where over a million Palestinians are seeking shelter. An Israeli military spokesperson said on Friday: &#8220;We are not waiting. We have begun preliminary operations and the initial stages of the attack on Gaza City, and we are currently operating with great force on the outskirts of the city. We will intensify our strikes.&#8221;</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Israeli attacks on Gaza City and northern Gaza intensified overnight, with explosions in the eastern Zeitoun neighborhood and heavy strikes near Beit Lahiya, where a tent sheltering displaced people was hit. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DN7fjToAoWr/">Footage posted on social media</a> and verified by Al Jazeera&#8217;s fact-checking agency, Sanad, shows huge explosions and massive plumes of smoke rising from Gaza City&#8217;s Zeitoun and Sabra neighborhoods.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Israeli Finance Minister <a href="https://x.com/DropSiteNews/status/1961174886476288298">Bezalel Smotrich</a> unveiled a hardline plan for &#8220;total victory&#8221; in Gaza on Thursday, centered on the destruction of Hamas, mass displacement of civilians, and eventual annexation of the territory. His proposal calls for forcing Palestinians into tightly controlled and concentrated camps under siege conditions dubbed &#8220;humanitarian zones.&#8221; The plan cuts off basic resources until Hamas surrenders or is destroyed. Smotrich argued that only annexation and large-scale emigration can guarantee deterrence, urging Netanyahu to adopt the plan immediately despite likely international backlash.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://x.com/IsraeliPM_heb/status/1961369146966643071">Prime Minister Netanyahu&#8217;s office</a> said Israeli forces have recovered the body of Illan Weiss, a member of the community emergency team of Kibbutz Be'eri killed on October 7, 2023. The office also claimed to have recovered, in the same operation, &#8220;findings of another deceased hostage, whose name has not yet been cleared for publication, were also recovered. The findings are currently undergoing identification at the Institute of Forensic Medicine.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><a href="https://x.com/DropSiteNews/status/1961132549175976056">UN human rights experts</a>, including the Working Group on Enforced Disappearances and Special Rapporteurs Francesca Albanese and Michael Fakhri, are alarmed by reports of enforced disappearances at Gaza Humanitarian Foundation aid distribution sites, warning that the reported acts constitute torture and a war crime. They cited cases in Rafah&#8212;including a child&#8212;where people vanished after seeking food. The UN urged dismantling the &#8220;inhumane&#8221; GHF system, restoring UN-led aid, and launching immediate investigations to hold those responsible accountable.</p></li></ul><h2>West Bank</h2><ul><li><p>Nine Palestinians have been arrested across the West Bank in Salfit governorate, Beit Hanina, and the city of el-Bireh today, according to the Palestinian Prisoners&#8217; Media Office. The arrests in Salfit included its head of the village council and a local school principal.</p></li><li><p>The Wafa news agency reports that three Palestinians have been arrested near Hebron in the occupied West Bank.</p></li><li><p>Israeli soldiers near Nablus <a href="https://x.com/DropSiteNews/status/1961227745486082360">detained a Palestinian child</a> who allegedly threw stones and a paint bottle at an armored vehicle, a day after a major raid in the area.

Joe Wilson,<a href="https://x.com/DropSiteNews/status/1961145401152868760"> urged Israel to halt its recent strikes</a> in Damascus, warning that such actions undermine Syria&#8217;s path to stability after 14 years of conflict. They praised President Trump&#8217;s earlier sanctions relief and highlighted historic meetings facilitated by Special Envoy Tom Barrack between Syrian and Israeli officials. The lawmakers cautioned that continued Israeli hostilities risk derailing fragile diplomatic progress and could squander an opportunity to reduce Iran&#8217;s influence and contain ISIS.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>The Trump administration is planning to launch a pilot program for Medicare that will require prior authorization for the first time in six states&#8212;Arizona, New Jersey, Ohio, Oklahoma, Texas, and Washington&#8212;covering high-cost procedures like spinal fusions and steroid injections. Private contractors will use AI to review claims, though final denials must be made by licensed clinicians; critics warn the financial incentives could encourage more rejections. While the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) says the program aims to curb wasteful or harmful care, others have argued&#8212;including patient advocates, physicians, and some lawmakers&#8212;the policy risks importing the delays and denials of Medicare Advantage, potentially giving for-profit firms undue control over care.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Rep.

areas of the Gaza Strip, in Nuseirat, on August 28, 2025 (Photo by EYAD BABA/AFP via Getty Images).</figcaption></figure></div><h2>The Genocide in Gaza</h2><ul><li><p>Gaza&#8217;s Ministry of Health reports at least 71 Palestinians killed and 339 injured in the past 24 hours. 22 Palestinians were killed and 203 injured while seeking aid. Four more deaths were recorded due to starvation and malnutrition. The total recorded death toll since October 7, 2023 is now 62,966 killed and 159,266 injured.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><a href="https://x.com/DropSiteNews/status/1960947898897535310">Strikes were reported </a>in northern, central, and southern Gaza yesterday killing at least 52 people. In Gaza City and the north, attacks hit residential buildings, refugee camps, and aid seekers, killing and wounding dozens while homes were demolished in multiple neighborhoods. Central and southern Gaza also came under heavy fire, with fatalities including a woman and child in Al-Bureij camp and 16 people in Khan Younis.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Israel&#8217;s military announced that the <a href="https://x.com/DropSiteNews/status/1960788664658595849">evacuation of Gaza City</a> is &#8220;inevitable,&#8221; claiming families moving south will receive aid in tent camps and distribution centers, despite reports that no space remains and no new shelter equipment has entered Gaza since March. Human rights groups warn that the plan amounts to concentration camps, aimed to control and ultimately expel over two million Palestinians as part of Israel&#8217;s next phase of war.</p></li><li><p>The mayor of <a href="https://x.com/DropSiteNews/status/1960961106714706151">Deir al-Balah</a> rejected the IDF&#8217;s claim that Gaza&#8217;s central camps have &#8220;vast empty areas,&#8221; saying there is no space for new tents as the coastline is overcrowded, the east is under bombardment, and infrastructure is collapsing. He warned that conditions across the central governorate are pushing it toward a humanitarian catastrophe if displacement continues. Gaza&#8217;s Government Media Office also responded in a statement saying that the Israeli military spokesperson&#8217;s claims are &#8220;part of a propaganda campaign aimed at breaking the steadfastness of our Palestinian people in Gaza and the north.&#8221;.&#8221;</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Gaza Civil Defense reported that over 1,500 residential buildings in <a href="https://x.com/DropSiteNews/status/1960943965101867234">Al-Zaytoun</a> have been completely destroyed since Israel&#8217;s ground operation began on August 6, leaving the area flattened. Spokesman Mahmoud Basal said similar devastation is unfolding in Jabaliya, with the army using heavy machinery, explosives, and drones to accelerate demolition. About 80% of Al-Zaytoun&#8217;s residents have been displaced to other parts of Gaza City.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Israel plans to open two additional <a href="https://x.com/DropSiteNews/status/1960822853043151128">Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF)</a> &#8220;aid&#8221; centers. Critics warn the militarized hubs force civilians to risk their lives for minimal food, with over 2,000 killed seeking aid since the program began.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Gaza&#8217;s media office reports that since March 2, Israel has been <a href="https://x.com/DropSiteNews/status/1960763447521763367">blocking essential foods</a> from reaching Palestinian civilians, including eggs, meat, fish, dairy, fruits, vegetables, and nutritional supplements. Dozens of other items, such as nuts and supplements for pregnant women and people with chronic illnesses, have also been prohibited.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>New from <a href="https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/us-contractors-gaza-pursued-mee-journalist-his-killing">Middle East Eye</a>: U.S. contractors in Gaza reportedly pursued journalist Mohammad Salama, with one of his sources interrogated at a GHF aid center about Salama&#8217;s identity and whereabouts days before he was killed at Nasser Hospital.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>A <a href="https://x.com/DropSiteNews/status/1960935955000373311">Sky News investigation</a> found that, of the six people Israel said were &#8220;terrorists&#8221; killed in its strike on Nasser Hospital, only one was identified as a fighter, and he was killed elsewhere two days prior to the strike on the hospital.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Hundreds of UN staff at the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights have called on UN human rights chief Volker Turk to explicitly call the Gaza war a genocide, according to a letter seen by<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/hundreds-un-staff-pressure-rights-chief-call-gaza-genocide-letter-shows-2025-08-28/"> Reuters</a>. In the letter signed by the Staff Committee on behalf of over 500 employees, they write: "OHCHR has a strong legal and moral responsibility to denounce acts of genocide. Failing to denounce an unfolding genocide undermines the credibility of the U.N. and the human rights system itself.&#8221; </p></li><li><p>Apart from the U.S., every UN Security Council member said the famine in Gaza is a &#8220;man-made crisis.&#8221; In a joint statement, 14 out of 15 member states of the council called for an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire, the release of all hostages held by Hamas and other groups, a substantive surge of aid throughout Gaza, and for Israel to immediately and unconditionally lift all restrictions on aid delivery. At the UN Security Council, U.S. Ambassador Dorothy Shea dismissed the IPC&#8217;s famine declaration in Gaza, accusing its authors of bias and claiming the report lacked credibility, without providing evidence to refute its findings.</p></li></ul><h2>Ceasefire Negotiations and Israeli News</h2><ul><li><p>White House special envoy Steve Witkoff has been working with Jared Kushner and Tony Blair on <a href="https://x.com/DropSiteNews/status/1960782507688796264">post-war Gaza plans</a>, briefing Donald Trump on proposals for governance without Hamas and expanded humanitarian aid amid deepening famine. Controversial elements of the plan, developed with Israeli businessmen and financial modeling by the Boston Consulting Group, reportedly included incentives to &#8220;relocate&#8221; up to half a million Palestinians, though Blair&#8217;s institute denied endorsing the concept.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Hamas political bureau officials <a href="https://x.com/DropSiteNews/status/1960873270649217215">rejected </a>Witkoff&#8217;s claim that Hamas is blocking Gaza ceasefire talks, saying the statements ignore Israel&#8217;s systematic obstruction and echo Netanyahu&#8217;s narrative. They noted Hamas had accepted a mediator-proposed deal, while Israel continues its military assault on Gaza City and ongoing civilian massacres.</p></li></ul><h2>U.S. News</h2><ul><li><p>U.S. Secretary of State <a href="https://x.com/DropSiteNews/status/1960801838888046831">Marco Rubio</a> met with Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa&#8217;ar at the State Department, posing for photos before starting discussions without taking questions. The meeting coincides with a White House-led session on post-war Gaza planning, following Sa&#8217;ar&#8217;s recent claim at the UN that hunger in Gaza is a &#8220;lie.&#8221;</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><a href="https://x.com/TaylorLorenz/status/1960744657329266878/photo/1">Taylor Lorenz</a> reports in Wired that a secretive Democratic influencer network, funded by the Sixteen Thirty Fund and run through the nonprofit arm of Good Influence, pays creators up to $8,000 a month under strict contracts that bar disclosure and allow forced content deletions. The program, called the Chorus Creator Incubator, has signed over 90 influencers with a reach of 40 million+, drawing criticism for using the same opaque tactics Democrats have condemned in the past.</p></li><li><p>The Trump administration fired Susan Monarez from her position as director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Wednesday amid pressure placed on the agency to change U.S. vaccine policy. Monarez&#8217;s lawyers say Monarez had refused to resign, and prior to her firing, her lawyers had written in a public statement that &#8220;When CDC Director Susan Monarez refused to rubber-stamp unscientific, reckless directives and fire dedicated health experts, she chose protecting the public over serving a political agenda. For that reason, she has been targeted.&#8221; In response, Monarez was immediately fired by the White House, and other senior CDC officials have since resigned in protest.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Biden National Security Advisor <a href="https://x.com/BulwarkOnline/status/1960832669056372883">Jake Sullivan</a> now claims he urged Democrats to vote against sending weapons to Israel.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Brad Pitt, Rooney Mara, Joaquin Phoenix, Alfonso Cuar&#243;n, and Jonathan Glazer have joined as executive producers of <a href="https://x.com/DropSiteNews/status/1960773810782658643">The Voice of Hind Rajab</a>, which is set to premiere at the Venice Film Festival. Directed by Kaouther Ben Hania, the film tells the story of the 6-year-old girl killed with her family in Gaza and will screen at several major international festivals.</p></li></ul><h2>International News</h2><ul><li><p>U.S. envoy Tom Barrack <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/27/us-envoy-cuts-lebanon-trip-short-amid-protests-outrage-over-press-comments?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email">cut short his visit</a> to southern Lebanon amid protests against Washington&#8217;s push to disarm Hezbollah and outrage over his comments telling journalists to &#8220;act civilized.&#8221; Demonstrations erupted in Khiam and Tyre, with Hezbollah supporters denouncing U.S. policies, while Lebanon plans to present a disarmament plan despite Hezbollah insisting Israel must first withdraw from Lebanese territory.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>The Ukrainian capital of Kyiv and several other regions of Ukraine were hit by a large-scale combined missile and drone assault overnight into Thursday, Ukrainian officials reported. At least 18 people, including four children, were killed in the capital. Reports indicate that high-speed Geran-3 drones equipped with jet engines were used in the attack. Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said in a post to Telegram that it was "a terrible night" for the capital, reporting "many damaged buildings" across five city districts.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Venezuela&#8217;s Defence Minister Vladimir Padrino announced the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/27/venezuela-deploys-warships-drones-to-coast-as-us-naval-squadron-nears?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email">deployment of naval vessels</a> and drones along the country&#8217;s Caribbean coast in response to the U.S. sending warships and thousands of troops to the region, citing drug trafficking concerns and offering rewards for the capture of President Maduro and other officials. Caracas condemned the U.S. actions as a threat to regional peace, mobilized militias and troops along the Colombian border, and dismantled drug-smuggling shipyards, while analysts suggest the military build-up is more posturing than an imminent invasion.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Syrian state media reports that <a href="https://x.com/DropSiteNews/status/1960907488250769440">Israeli strikes on Damascus</a> killed at least eight soldiers after Syrian troops discovered Israeli surveillance devices near Mount al-Manea. The escalation included multiple air raids, drone strikes, and a helicopter airdrop targeting military sites, prompting Damascus to condemn the attacks as a serious violation of sovereignty.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>The US has imposed punitive 50% tariffs on Indian imports in response to New Delhi&#8217;s continued purchases of discounted Russian oil, adding onto another 25% tariff already imposed on New Delhi. The move significantly strains trade relations between the two countries and threatens key sectors of the Indian economy such as textiles, gems, shrimp, and carpets. The move, seen by some as pressure on Russia via India, comes amid stalled trade talks and deteriorating ties between U.S. and Indian leaders and could reduce Indian exports to the US by nearly 40%, risking hundreds of thousands of jobs.</p></li></ul><h2>More from Drop Site</h2><ul><li><p><em>Israeli forces are pushing deeper into Gaza City with tanks, warplanes, and drones, leveling entire neighborhoods and forcing thousands to flee as famine and mass displacement worsen.

The escalating assault comes amid a widening famine, with Palestinians starving to death every day. Airstrikes continue to pound civilians in central and southern Gaza.

No human being is spared,&#8221; a man displaced from Jabalia Al-Nazla, told Drop Site. &#8220;What&#8217;s happening now is forced displacement&#8212;non-voluntary.&#8221;</p><p>Church leaders in Gaza City on Wednesday announced they would not leave the city. &#8220;Trying to flee to the south would be nothing less than a death sentence,&#8221; they said. The joint statement by the Greek Orthodox and Latin Patriarchates of Jerusalem said they &#8220;have decided to remain and continue to care for all those who will be in the compounds.&#8221;</p><p>Israel has only doubled down on its plans to seize Gaza City with an Israeli military spokesperson insisting on Wednesday that "evacuating Gaza City is inevitable&#8221; and publishing a new map showing areas in central and southern Gaza that he claimed were empty for Palestinians to displace to &#8220;before the next phase of the war.&#8221;</p><div class="image-gallery-embed" data-attrs="{&quot;gallery&quot;:{&quot;images&quot;:[{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c1f37812-dcec-4fe0-8d5c-813d8d70f8c8_3014x1694.png&quot;},{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2fced0b9-b7e4-49b3-aa9a-548b104fead4_3014x1698.png&quot;}],&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;Hamed Hleiwa, a Palestinian man from Gaza City, has been displaced to a tent on the coast of the city.

Jabalia town and Jabalia Al-Nazla have been completely destroyed,&#8221; Mohammed Abu Al-Saeed told Drop Site. &#8220;There&#8217;s no house left, no stone, no street, nothing. Just a while ago, we were shocked when the tank and bulldozer reached Saftawi roundabout and started operating. When people saw that scene, they fled in a massive and terrifying way.&#8221; He added, &#8220;Even if we wanted to evacuate, we wouldn&#8217;t know where to go. There is absolutely no safe place in the Gaza Strip&#8230;Young people are dying in the streets. Women are dying in the streets. We&#8217;ve become a displaced people.&#8221;</p><p>For many families, they simply cannot or will not displace to the south. With massive fuel shortages, the cost of getting a car from the north to the south can top 2,000 shekels (about $600) and many are unable to make the arduous journey to areas in central and southern Gaza that are nevertheless repeatedly attacked by Israel. As Palestinians in Gaza City are driven further west toward the sea by the incoming Israeli assault, the city&#8217;s coastline has been transformed into a mass tent encampment.</p><div class="native-video-embed" data-component-name="VideoPlaceholder" data-attrs="{&quot;mediaUploadId&quot;:&quot;a9b040cb-2551-480f-8565-168da99c38a5&quot;,&quot;duration&quot;:null}"></div><p><em>A mass tent encampment on the coastline of Gaza City. August 26, 2025. (Video by Abdel Qader Sabbah)</em></p><p>&#8220;We simply can&#8217;t go to the south, and the reason is clear: lack of money. We don&#8217;t have the basics of life necessary to move to the south. We don&#8217;t have access to jeeps or cars to transport us or our belongings. Also, there isn&#8217;t enough food,&#8221; Hamed Hleiwa, a Palestinian man from Gaza City, told Drop Site, near the tent where he was living with his children. &#8220;The bigger issue is that the south, where Israel tells us to go&#8212;specifically Al-Mawasi in Khan Younis&#8212;there&#8217;s no space there. There are no available areas. It&#8217;s already overcrowded. It&#8217;s packed with people from Rafah, packed with people from Khan Younis, and packed with people from the north who haven&#8217;t returned to northern Gaza yet.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Displacement requires essentials: food, money and transportation. So even if I&#8217;m going to die here, I won&#8217;t leave,&#8221; Hleiwa said in reference to Gaza City. &#8220;I would leave, but I can&#8217;t.&#8221;</p><p><em>Sharif Abdel Kouddous and Jawa Ahmad contributed to this report</em></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.dropsitenews.com/p/gaza-city-displacement-israeli-offensive-saftawi/comments&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Leave a comment&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://www.dropsitenews.com/p/gaza-city-displacement-israeli-offensive-saftawi/comments"><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.dropsitenews.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://www.dropsitenews.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[“Nothing More Than a Piece of Paper”: Armenians Displaced From Nagorno-Karabakh Say New Peace Accord With Azerbaijan Abandons Rights and Accountability]]></title><description><![CDATA[Trump&#8217;s gestural peace deal between Armenia and Azerbaijan ignores the conflict&#8217;s main victims from Nagorno-Karabakh and excludes their right to return home.]]></description><link>https://www.dropsitenews.com/p/armenia-azerbaijan-nagorno-karabakh-displacement-right-to-retun-conflict-trump</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.dropsitenews.com/p/armenia-azerbaijan-nagorno-karabakh-displacement-right-to-retun-conflict-trump</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Emily Wilder]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 27 Aug 2025 16:58:44 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!M4oI!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5014c21f-37d5-46ae-9767-81c2caecaadf_6000x4000.jpeg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>We have a commitment to ensuring that our journalism is not locked behind a paywall.

But with this accord, we've finally succeeded in making peace,&#8221; Trump <a href="http://www.youtube.com/live/EKHlDnl2tQg">told</a> the press following the meeting, adding that the two countries &#8220;are committing to stop all fighting forever, open up commerce, travel, and diplomatic relations, and respect each other's sovereignty and territorial integrity, so importantly. . . . So they're going to be able to really live and work together, and it's amazing.&#8221; Armenia and Azerbaijan are among the states signaling that the Nobel Peace Prize should go to President Trump, who recently referred to Armenia as <a href="https://www.marklevinshow.com/2025/08/19/august-19th-2025/">Albania</a> when touting his diplomatic successes regarding the conflict.</p><p>While the treaty process was initialized, no formal agreement has been signed. A <a href="https://www.mfa.am/en/press-releases/2025/08/11/Initialed%20Arm-Az%20Peace%20Agreement%20text/13394">draft</a> released by Armenia and Azerbaijan includes provisions for the cessation of hostilities and recognition of respective sovereignty. The two South Caucuses countries&#8212;at war between 1988 and 1994 and again in 2020&#8212;have been engaged in complicated negotiations over a peace treaty and border demarcation for nearly two years.</p><p>But the announcement of the peace process made no reference to Nagorno-Karabakh&#8212;a self-governing region within Azerbaijan that was majority Armenian&#8212;or to the as many as 150,000 ethnic Armenians <a href="https://theintercept.com/2023/10/04/intercepted-nagorno-karabakh-azerbaijan-armenians/">displaced</a> between 2020 and 2023. Meanwhile, alongside the declaration, Aliyev and Pashinyan indicated they would sign a joint request to dissolve the <a href="https://www.osce.org/mg">Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Minsk Group</a>, the multilateral, European body formed in 1992 that was tasked and failed to facilitate a solution to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and encourage the voluntary return of displaced people on both sides. Azerbaijani officials said the OSCE was set to terminate its Minsk Group operations September 1, a precondition for Azerbaijan to sign the draft agreement, Armenian outlets <a href="https://www.azatutyun.am/a/minski-khoumby-pakelou-veraberyal-eahk-i-oroshoumn-aknkalvoum-e-septemberi-1-in-bayramov/33513459.html">reported</a> Tuesday.</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.dropsitenews.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Subscribe to Drop Site News.</p></div><form class="subscription-widget-subscribe"><input type="email" class="email-input" name="email" placeholder="Type your email&#8230;" tabindex="-1"><input type="submit" class="button primary" value="Subscribe"><div class="fake-input-wrapper"><div class="fake-input"></div><div class="fake-button"></div></div></form></div></div><p>&#8220;The conflict cannot be deemed resolved while an entire population remains uprooted, deprived of its inalienable rights. Our displacement was neither voluntary nor incidental&#8212;it resulted from siege, starvation, and military assault, actions that remain unaddressed by the international community,&#8221; the National Assembly of Nagorno-Karabakh wrote in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ArtsakhInformation/posts/%D5%AC%D5%A5%D5%BC%D5%B6%D5%A1%D5%B5%D5%AB%D5%B6-%D5%B2%D5%A1%D6%80%D5%A1%D5%A2%D5%A1%D5%B2%D5%AB-%D5%BF%D5%A5%D5%B2%D5%A1%D5%B0%D5%A1%D5%B6%D5%BE%D5%A1%D5%AE-%D5%AA%D5%B8%D5%B2%D5%B8%D5%BE%D6%80%D5%A4%D5%AB-%D5%A1%D5%B6%D5%B8%D6%82%D5%B6%D5%AB%D6%81%D5%A4%D5%AB%D5%B4%D5%B8%D6%82%D5%B4%D5%A5%D5%A1%D5%B0%D5%AF-%D5%B4%D5%A1%D5%BD%D5%B6%D5%A1%D5%AF%D5%AB%D6%81-%D5%BA%D5%A5%D5%BF%D5%B8%D6%82%D5%A9%D5%B5%D5%B8%D6%82%D5%B6%D5%B6%D5%A5%D6%80%D5%AB%D5%B6/1071240855192700/">public appeal</a> to the OSCE. The assembly was especially concerned that &#8220;[dissolving] this mechanism without consulting the elected representatives of the people for whom it was established is to disregard our voice and deny our role in the process.&#8221;</p><p>In September 2023, after years of alleged abuses by Azerbaijani forces against Armenian civilians and soldiers&#8212;including <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/press-release/2020/12/armenia-azerbaijan-decapitation-and-war-crimes-in-gruesome-videos-must-be-urgently-investigated/">beheadings</a> and <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2021/03/19/azerbaijan-armenian-pows-abused-custody">torture&#8212;</a>and a 9-month Azerbaijani <a href="https://theintercept.com/2023/01/20/deconstructed-armenia-azerbaijan-nagorno-karabakh/">military blockade</a> of movement and humanitarian aid into the region, Azerbaijan began shelling the capital city of Stepanakert and other areas of Nagorno-Karabakh for two days. Following the surprise bombardment, Azerbaijan opened the one road from Nagorno-Karabakh into Armenia, and in the course of ten days, over 100,000 Armenians fled&#8212;an event that human rights experts <a href="https://freedomhouse.org/article/new-report-azerbaijani-regime-ethnically-cleansed-nagorno-karabakh-according-international">described</a> as <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/P-9-2023-002865_EN.html">ethnic cleansing</a>, even <a href="https://genocidescholars.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IAGS-Resolution-on-Nagorno-Karabakh.pdf">genocide</a>. Only a few dozen Armenian people remain in Nagorno-Karabakh, according to representatives, while the rest have resettled in Armenia, Russia, and elsewhere.</p><p>That November, the International Court of Justice <a href="https://www.icj-cij.org/node/203314">issued</a> provisional measures that Azerbaijan ensure the &#8220;safe, unimpeded and expeditious&#8221; return of displaced Armenians from Nagorno-Karabakh, a ruling echoed by the <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/TA-9-2023-0356_EN.html">European Parliament</a> and sought ever since by diplomatic efforts like the <a href="https://www.swisspeacekarabakh.com/en/factsheet">Swiss Peace Initiative</a>. Despite this, in his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBubaW6dxRk">address</a> from the Armenian Parliament last week following the meeting in Washington, Pashinyan said that the continued pursuit of return for the displaced would threaten peace with Azerbaijan, and that &#8220;with our support and that of the international community, they should be resettled in the Republic of Armenia and live, create, and establish themselves here as full citizens of the Republic of Armenia.&#8221;</p><p>In response to the move to settle the conflict without guarantees for return, the Committee for the Defense of the Fundamental Rights of the People of Nagorno-Karabakh, a body in Armenia representing the displaced community, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ArtsakhCommittee/posts/pfbid0Wr46SKEcF3XUkxywQKEb8c5NNe4iUEDxSoppFqaxwBb4FF6mSzdTw7Cbsj5FFSMil">stated</a> that &#8220;Any agreement that disregards their rights, erases their history, or sacrifices their future is not a peace agreement, but an act of appeasement that rewards aggression and source of future conflict.&#8221;</p><p>Human rights experts and analysts have cast doubt on the recent bilateral agreement, saying it shuts the door on accountability for victims of crimes and fails to lead to true justice and repair. "I think it is nothing more than a piece of paper that will not bring peace to this region, because it ignores the very reason for the conflict, and it fails to properly address the roots of the conflict," said Gegham Stepanyan, the human rights ombudsperson for Nagorno-Karabakh, also called the Republic of Artsakh, who retained his role after he was displaced to Armenia in 2023, in an interview with Drop Site News. "It means that Armenia, together with Azerbaijan, normalizes war crimes, normalizes the violation of basic human rights, and betrays the rights of 150,000 people. . . . It means human rights are being sacrificed to the economic interests of states or other interests I do not know."</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.dropsitenews.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://www.dropsitenews.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p>Meanwhile, Richard Giragosyan, an analyst in Armenia&#8217;s capital of Yerevan, said that provisions in the agreement seem to require that Armenia &#8220;effectively abandon any support or backing for international legal challenges to Azerbaijan's war of 2020, the ethnic cleansing and forced expulsion for the Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh."</p><p>Alongside the declaration to end the conflict, Trump claimed that Aliyev and Pashinyan also signed separate trade and economic cooperation deals with the United States, including waiving a U.S. law from the 90s banning U.S. military aid to Azerbaijan, though those agreements were not released. The three leaders announced a route along Armenia&#8217;s southern border with Iran to connect Azerbaijan to its exclave Nakhchivan, dubbed the Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity, or the TRIPP.</p><p>Artak Beglaryan, former Artsakh human rights ombudsperson and current president of Artsakh Union, an NGO advocating for rights of the displaced community, told Drop Site that the communities most impacted by the conflict would not see immediate benefit as a result of the agreements. "Even if there are benefits, it will be in years, if not decades," said Beglaryan, who was himself forced to move in 2023. "Our social needs are quite immediate and urgent now."</p><p>Nearly two years following the mass exodus, the majority of the displaced live in Armenia, where they face enormous <a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/armenia/paths-stability-socio-economic-perspectives-displaced-populations-nagorno-karabakh-after-year-displacement-aragatsotn-shirak-ararat-tavush-and-syunik-regions-needs-assessment-report-december-2024-0">economic disadvantages</a>, competing in tight housing and job markets and having to start over after leaving almost all their material possessions, land, and memories behind. "This situation, this social crisis that we are now in, is the consequence of the displacement. We don't need to address those problems. We need to address the reasons for those problems, and we want to return to our homes," Beglaryan said.</p><p>The government of Nagorno-Karabakh formed after the enclave declared independence from Azerbaijan by popular referendum in 1991. Since its September 2023 disbandment, the embattled republic has reconstituted in skeleton form in an unofficial embassy building in Yerevan, where it now primarily advocates for the socioeconomic welfare and human rights of the displaced community in Armenia. Civil society in Armenia has also organized around these issues, most recently in a <a href="https://armenianweekly.com/2025/03/31/rallies-in-yerevan-demand-rights-and-dignity-for-artsakhs-displaced-armenians/">series</a> of <a href="https://armenianweekly.com/2025/07/24/artsakh-rights-under-threat-as-displacement-crisis-deepens-in-armenia/">sit-ins</a> at the capital attracting thousands over the spring and summer.</p><p>According to the displaced community&#8217;s representatives, the people of Arsakh have been excluded from the peace and normalization process not only in Washington but also in Armenia. No member of the displaced community was engaged in or has been notified of the deals made at the White House, Beglaryan said.</p><p>&#8220;It was not a surprise for me, because we have a long history of being ignored,&#8221; Beglaryan said. He disputed that the meeting has generated a peace agreement, but rather a "geopolitical trade deal mostly for PR purposes." Stepanyan agreed that Friday <a href="https://armenianweekly.com/2025/08/10/do-i-exist/">proved</a> that it is &#8220;very much like we do not exist, like we do not have any rights, like we are no one.&#8221;</p><p>Real justice that can lead to sustainable peace, Beglaryan said, requires that the communities whose rights were violated be &#8220;invited into the negotiations as a party, or included in the Armenian delegation. Our voice should be heard.&#8221;</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank"

the displaced community now living in Tashir, Armenia, June 2025 (photo by author).</figcaption></figure></div><h2>The Right to Return After Two Years of Displacement</h2><p>On a wet June afternoon, two months prior to the White House&#8217;s announcement, around two dozen people sat in a wide circle on the second floor of the cultural center in the northern Armenia city of Tashir when Irina Grigoryan arrived. An educator and organizer from Nagorno-Karabakh, Grigoryan had traveled two hours to Tashir from Yerevan to meet with resettled Artsakhtsis and conduct a needs assessment&#8212;one of several she has done with Indie Peace, a British organization, that works in areas where those who left Nagorno-Karabakh between 2020 and 2023 reside.</p><p>Around 1,500 Artsakhtsis have resettled in Tashir. Those in attendance that day shared with Grigoryan how they are struggling with a host of economic and social issues. Some described discrimination against the Artsakh dialect of Armenian. Many lamented difficulties finding employment. Most were concerned about the impending end to an aid program for displaced people by the Armenian government, without which "they will be in a very dangerous position and even lose the houses that they are renting," said Grigoryan.</p><p>"We can't plan our future, because every day we face changes, and we don&#8217;t know what will happen," said one elderly woman.</p><p>In the subsequent months the situation has only worsened, according to Beglaryan, with "the number of people in poverty and the depth of poverty . . . increasing," he said. Following cuts to the social support program over the summer, human rights ombudsperson Stepanyan said, he has received over 100 calls a day to his office phone from people "saying they do not have money to cover rental costs."</p><p>Alongside wage and rent troubles, many also live with the memory of major traumatic events&#8212;particularly the children who endured drone bombardment and extreme deprivation during the blockade, Grigoryan said. In the Tashir meeting, a child sitting with her mother shyly refused a cookie from a plate Grigoryan had passed around, only conceding with encouragement from the entire room.</p><p>"Our children grow up earlier because of the war. The blockade, the war, this displacement, took childhood from our children," Grigoryan said. She recalled how her own grandson, at just 8-years old, woke up early in the morning to wait in line for bread during the height of food shortages in Nagorno-Karabakh.</p><p>Some felt their struggles could be resolved if they could safely return to their homes. One woman, Liana, told Grigoryan that she would know how to subsist on less back in Nagorno-Karabakh: "I can grab anything to live off, even from the ground, but only in our home."</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!vEdS!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa258bc64-a4de-400b-a4b2-c3e58f386760_6000x4000.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!vEdS!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa258bc64-a4de-400b-a4b2-c3e58f386760_6000x4000.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!vEdS!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa258bc64-a4de-400b-a4b2-c3e58f386760_6000x4000.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!vEdS!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa258bc64-a4de-400b-a4b2-c3e58f386760_6000x4000.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!vEdS!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa258bc64-a4de-400b-a4b2-c3e58f386760_6000x4000.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!vEdS!,w_2400,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa258bc64-a4de-400b-a4b2-c3e58f386760_6000x4000.jpeg" width="1200" height="800.2747252747253" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a258bc64-a4de-400b-a4b2-c3e58f386760_6000x4000.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:false,&quot;imageSize&quot;:&quot;large&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:971,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:1200,&quot;bytes&quot;:9666560,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.dropsitenews.com/i/171997733?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa258bc64-a4de-400b-a4b2-c3e58f386760_6000x4000.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:&quot;center&quot;,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-large" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!vEdS!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa258bc64-a4de-400b-a4b2-c3e58f386760_6000x4000.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!vEdS!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa258bc64-a4de-400b-a4b2-c3e58f386760_6000x4000.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!vEdS!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa258bc64-a4de-400b-a4b2-c3e58f386760_6000x4000.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!vEdS!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa258bc64-a4de-400b-a4b2-c3e58f386760_6000x4000.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Three residents of Tashir, Armenia, where 1,500 people displaced from Nagorno-Karabakh now live, June 2025 (photo by author).</figcaption></figure></div><p>People are working to survive in Armenia and want supportive policies, like continued aid from the government, Beglaryan said. "On the other hand, the majority of people want to return upon the chance.&#8221;</p><p>Grigoryan agreed that, in her assessments, "every person wants to go home, but it depends on the circumstances,&#8221; such as guarantees for protection of language and culture. Though there has not been a formal survey of the issue among the Artsakhtsi community, Beglaryan added that, according to his communication and outreach, &#8220;Nobody thinks that it&#8217;s possible to return under Azerbaijani genocidal control.&#8221;</p><p>Sayida Poghosyan, an Artsakhtsi organizer providing cultural and social services for other displaced families across Armenia, said that "although we know that this is temporarily impossible, we do not give up our right to . . . the collective and safe return to our homeland."</p><p>Azerbaijan has called the mass flight of Nagorno-Karabakh&#8217;s Armenians voluntary and promised to protect the rights of Nagorno-Karabakh&#8217;s Armenians. Human Rights Watch, however, <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/10/05/guarantee-right-return-nagorno-karabakh">said</a> in October 2023 that &#8220;such assertions are difficult to accept at face value after the months of severe hardships, decades of conflict, impunity for alleged crimes, in particular during hostilities, and the Azerbaijani government&#8217;s overall deteriorating human rights record.&#8221;</p><p>International human rights lawyer and University of Southern California professor Steve Swerdlow met with members of the displaced community in Armenia over the summer, and he said that the right of return, though politically deprioritized, is &#8220;still in the hearts of more than 120,000 people."</p><p>Though the deal makes formal mention of abiding by states&#8217; obligations under international law by claiming that the agreement &#8220;does not infringe upon the rights and obligations of the Parties under international law,&#8221; Stepanyan was not convinced that such language would genuinely extend to the right of return, referring to it as "diplomatic jargon, nothing else."</p><p>Both Stepanyan and Beglaryan contended that the exclusion of the conflict&#8217;s primary victims, now ratified in the trilateral document, is evidence of the weakness and failure of the international legal system&#8212;laid bare by mounting belligerence <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/08/08/gaza-israel-trump-nagorno-karabakh-peace/">elsewhere</a>. &#8220;All that we read in our textbooks, all that we studied in our international law classes, is something like a fairytale,&#8221; Stepanyan said. &#8220;It is written on papers but it is very much ignored when states are being guided by their economic and political interests.&#8221;</p><p><em>Disclosure: Emily Wilder is an independent journalist and a researcher for the University Network for Human Rights, which has investigated human rights issues in Armenia

Eighteen were killed while seeking aid, and 106 injured. 10 died of starvation and malnutrition, including two children. The total death toll since October 7, 2023 is now 62,895 killed and 158,927 injured.</p></li><li><p>Ahmad al-Batniji, 17, has died from severe malnutrition. Ahmad lived with Celiac disease, requiring gluten-free food and proper medical care. For months, Israel&#8217;s siege has blocked essential supplies, depriving him and thousands of others with chronic conditions of what they need to survive.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>The Israeli military is pushing deeper into Gaza City with tanks and warplanes, destroying entire neighbourhoods and leaving Palestinian residents with nowhere safe to go. Israel&#8217;s bombardment of three of the city&#8217;s eastern suburbs&#8212;Shejaia, Zeitoun and Sabra&#8212;is particularly intense, prompting thousands to flee.</p></li><li><p>The Greek Orthodox and Latin Patriarchates of Jerusalem issued a joint statement confirming that churches in Gaza City&#8212;including St. Porphyrius and the Holy Family compound&#8212;will continue to shelter civilians during Israel&#8217;s planned assault. Clergy and nuns said they will remain to care for those unable or unwilling to evacuate, warning that leaving often amounts to a &#8220;death sentence&#8221; due to starvation and the dangers of flight.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>The death toll from Israel&#8217;s &#8220;double tap&#8221; bombing of Nasser hospital on Monday has risen to 22 after two more Palestinians died of their wounds, according to the ministry of health.</p><p><br>The Israeli military claimed without evidence on Tuesday that it was targeting a surveillance camera operated by Hamas. The initial strike killed journalist Hossam al-Masri, a cameraman with Reuters who was doing a live shot from the fourth floor of the hospital, and one other person. Israel did not provide any explanation as to why it bombed the hospital a second time approximately 15 minutes later when medics, emergency rescue workers and journalists had arrived on the scene resulting in a much higher number of casualties.</p><p><br>Journalist Abdallah Alattar described walking to Nasser Hospital&#8217;s morgue this morning, where southern Gaza&#8217;s press corps normally gathers to document funerals. &#8220;Today, I stood on the sidelines, looking around me and finding only three colleagues beside me &#8212; in the place where more than 20 journalists stood every morning,&#8221; he said. At least eight of his colleagues were missing: five murdered in Monday&#8217;s double-tap strike on the hospital, and three more injured.</p></li><li><p>News agencies, including Reuters and AP, have come under criticism for their coverage of Israel&#8217;s killing of journalists, including journalists who work with them. A Canadian photojournalist Valerie Zink working with Reuters resigned over the outlet&#8217;s response to Israel&#8217;s killing of journalists, including Al-Masri and Anas al-Sharif earlier this month who was part of a 2024 Reuters Pulitzer Prize winning team. &#8220;I have valued the work that I brought to Reuters over the past eight years, but at this point I can&#8217;t conceive of wearing this press pass with anything but deep shame and grief,&#8221; she said.</p></li><li><p>The Qassam Brigades aired footage of a July 7 ambush in Beit Hanoun that killed five Israeli soldiers and wounded about 20. The video shows an Israeli unit advancing near the Erez crossing before being struck by two hidden explosives and anti-personnel mines, part of Qassam&#8217;s &#8220;Stones of David&#8221; operations. Spokesman Abu Ubaida called it &#8220;a blow to the hollow prestige of the occupation army.&#8221;</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Human Rights Watch said U.S. military personnel could face legal liability for assisting Israeli forces who commit war crimes in Gaza. &#8220;Direct participation by US forces in military operations in Gaza since October 2023, including by providing intelligence for Israeli strikes and conducting extensive coordination and planning, has made the United States a party to the conflict between Israel and Palestinian armed groups. As a warring party, US forces could be jointly responsible for participating in laws-of-war violations by Israeli forces, and US personnel implicated could be held individually responsible for war crimes,&#8221; the group said.</p></li></ul><h2>West Bank</h2><ul><li><p>An ongoing raid in Nablus has injured at least 80. The raid began at 3 a.m. local time, according to <a href="https://www.middleeasteye.net/live-blog/live-blog-update/least-80-palestinians-injured-israeli-raid-nablus">Middle East Eye</a>, and appears to be ongoing. Nablus Governor Daghlas told the AFP the army had informed Palestinian authorities that the raid would last until 4:00 p.m.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>PA President Mahmoud Abbas met U.S. senators Chris Van Hollen and Jeff Merkley in Ramallah today. Journalist @infinite_jaz reports the senators also met with the parents of imprisoned American Mohammed Zaher Ibrahim and murdered American Sayfollah Musallet, along with families of other Palestinian Americans killed in the occupied West Bank. They reportedly vowed to press U.S. Ambassador Mike Huckabee to demand Israel free 16-year-old Ibrahim from the Megiddo torture camp and seek justice for the others.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Over 100 groups sent a letter to U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/26/american-palestinian-teenager-israeli-prison">advocating</a> for the immediate release of Mohammed Zaher Ibrahim, a Palestinian-American teenager detained in an Israeli prison under allegations of throwing rocks. &#8220;Mohammed&#8217;s health is dire and requires your immediate action to ensure Mohammed is free, safe, and with his parents,&#8221; the groups, which include CAIR, CODEPINK, Muslim American Society, and Democratic Socialists of America, write,&#8221;&#8212;his life is on the line.&#8221;</p></li></ul><h2>Ceasefire Negotiations and Diplomacy</h2><ul><li><p>On Fox News, anchor Bret Baier opened his interview with Trump&#8217;s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff by falsely claiming &#8220;Hamas leaders&#8221; were present at Gaza&#8217;s Nasser Hospital during the double-tap strike that killed five journalists, medics, and patients&#8212;a claim not even Netanyahu has made. Asked about foreign journalists being barred from Gaza, Witkoff responded not with concern for press freedom but by boasting he has entered Gaza twice, &#8220;wearing a ceramic vest&#8221; and a MAGA hat, and that people &#8220;cheered&#8221; when they saw it. He offered no comment on the safety of Palestinian reporters or the systematic targeting of the press.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Witkoff also confirmed that Washington has abandoned the &#8220;Witkoff Proposal&#8221;&#8212;a phased ceasefire framework he and Israeli minister Ron Dermer crafted in June. Hamas accepted the plan last week, but Witkoff said Trump&#8217;s official position now mirrors Israel&#8217;s: only a deal releasing all Israeli captives at once. He added that Trump will chair an expanded White House meeting on Gaza today, focused on a &#8220;very comprehensive&#8221; day-after plan, which he claimed will reflect the president&#8217;s &#8220;heartfelt motives.&#8221; Hamas officials have accused both Israel and the U.S. of deliberately stalling negotiations to provide cover for their genocidal war on Gaza.</p></li></ul><h2>U.S. Politics</h2><ul><li><p>At its summer meeting in Minneapolis, the Democratic National Committee rejected a resolution calling for an arms embargo on Israel, despite a July Gallup poll showing only 8% of Democrats support Israel&#8217;s Gaza war. Resolution 18, introduced by Gen-Z member Allison Minnerly, called for an immediate ceasefire, suspension of U.S. aid, and recognition of Palestine, but was blocked in committee. Instead, DNC Chair Ken Martin announced a task force to continue the debate after withdrawing a weaker rival measure. The pro-Israel group Democratic Majority for Israel praised the outcome, claiming it showed party unity behind U.S. military aid to Israel.</p></li><li><p>A study reviewed by The Lever finds that major outlets&#8212;including WSJ, NYT, WaPo, FT, Bloomberg, CNBC, Axios, and Politico&#8212;have routinely blamed inflation on droughts, tariffs, or wages while largely ignoring corporate profiteering. On average, 60% of articles since 2023 omitted greedflation as a factor, with Axios never mentioning it and CNBC leaving it out 73% of the time. The study says this media spin fueled policies cutting aid and blocking wage hikes. With Trump scrapping Biden&#8217;s antitrust order and tariffs driving new price spikes, economists warn corporations are again exploiting crises to gouge consumers.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Microsoft employees and the No Azure for Apartheid movement occupied the office of company president Brad Smith on Tuesday, declaring a &#8220;Liberated Zone&#8221; inside the executive Building 34, renamed the Mai Ubeid Building after a Palestinian engineer killed in an Israeli strike. Bloomberg reported the company has spent the past year trying to crush worker dissent over its ties to Israel&#8217;s war on Gaza&#8212;enlisting the FBI, working with police, censoring posts, and firing employees. Despite repression, organizers say they will not stop until Microsoft ends its Azure and AI contracts with Israel&#8217;s military, pays reparations to Palestinians, and halts workplace discrimination.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Later that day, Microsoft President Brad Smith held a press briefing. Asked about the company&#8217;s work with Israel, he admitted: &#8220;The vast majority of what Microsoft does for the Israeli military is protect the cybersecurity of the state of Israel&#8230; There are some other activities as well. That involves the use of Azure for storage for example, for processing of data.&#8221; On August 6, The Guardian, with +972 Magazine and Local Call, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/06/microsoft-israeli-military-palestinian-phone-calls-cloud">revealed</a> that Israel&#8217;s Unit 8200 has used Microsoft&#8217;s Azure cloud to archive and analyze &#8220;a million calls an hour&#8221; of Palestinian phone data&#8212;one of the largest surveillance systems ever built for a civilian population. Leaked documents show Microsoft executives, including CEO Satya Nadella, knew the system was being used to plan airstrikes in Gaza and the West Bank, prompting a second external investigation into whether Microsoft is violating its own human rights policies.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Delta Airlines faces a $20 million lawsuit after passenger Mohammad Shibli said he was slapped in the face by a flight attendant when his wife, wearing a Palestinian shirt, asked for water. Witnesses confirmed the alleged assault, which the FBI is investigating. Attorney Ali Awad says the case reflects entrenched anti-Palestinian bias at Delta, citing past discrimination reports and a 2023 incident where a Delta employee assaulted a traveler. His firm is demanding damages, Palestine sensitivity training for employees, and one day of the airline&#8217;s profits, arguing Delta has fostered a culture where violence and bias can thrive.</p></li><li><p>Silicon Valley billionaires have launched a $100 million super PAC called Leading the Future to back &#8220;pro-AI&#8221; politicians in 2026, The Washington Post reports. Early backers include OpenAI president Greg Brockman, his wife Anna, and venture firm Andreessen Horowitz, which also supported Trump in 2024. Modeled on the crypto PAC Fairshake, the group aims to sideline &#8220;AI doomers,&#8221; block regulation, and promote policies like copyright scraping and massive new data centers. The PAC will operate nationally and in key state races in New York, California, Illinois, and Ohio. Critics warn it could reshape Congress much like crypto money did in 2024.</p></li></ul><h2>International News</h2><ul><li><p>Britain, France and Germany are <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/europeans-likely-initiate-un-sanctions-process-iran-thursday-sources-say-2025-08-27/">reportedly</a> set to begin the process of reimposing U.N. sanctions on Iran on Thursday over outstanding disputes related to its nuclear program. The sanctions were lifted under a 2015 nuclear accord, but are set to be reimposed following the violation of the deal by the U.S. under the first Trump administration, the resumption of high-level uranium enrichment by Iran, and recent Israeli and U.S. attacks on Iran&#8217;s nuclear program. Iran and the European Union are still engaged in talks aimed at potentially averting a new confrontation over the program, with international monitors reportedly returning to the country this week.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>U.S. officials have <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/66ec25a0-4af8-467f-9fbe-cf42de890a7e">informed</a> their European Union counterparts that they are prepared to provide intelligence support, air defense, and other forms of military assistance to a post-war plan intended to provide security guarantees for Ukraine against further attack. The deployment would not include U.S troops on the ground serving as peacekeepers, but would involve them working in a support role for a broader European Union mission.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>President Donald Trump&#8217;s threatened 50% tariff on Indian goods <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/27/economy/trump-india-tariff">came into effect</a> today, doubling the previously announced tariff rate on goods coming from the country. The measure has been described by the Trump administration as a punitive step aimed at punishing India for its purchases of sanctioned Russian oil during the Ukraine conflict. The sanctions come as the U.S. has also been seeking to cooperate with India as part of an Indo-Pacific partnership to contain Chinese influence in the region.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Venezuela has <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/27/venezuela-deploys-warships-drones-to-coast-as-us-naval-squadron-nears">said</a> that it is deploying warships and drones near its coast in response to a U.S. military buildup in the region. The U.S. government has threatened to carry out military operations in the region targeting drug cartels, while also making threats against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, including placing a $50 million bounty for his capture or prosecution on allegations of drug trafficking. Venezuela has said that the U.S. deployment represents, &#8220;a serious threat to regional peace and security&#8221;</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Syrian state TV reported that six Syrian soldiers were killed in Israeli drone strikes on the Damascus countryside early Wednesday. A Syrian defense source told AFP the strikes hit a military building of the 44th Division in Kiswah, west of Damascus. The IDF gave no immediate comment, but Israel has carried out hundreds of attacks across Syria targeting army and Iran-linked positions. The strike follows air raids on central Damascus weeks ago that killed at least three people, and comes amid U.S.-mediated discussions aimed at easing hostilities in southern Syria. Prime Minister Netanyahu has vowed to keep striking Syria as part of Israel&#8217;s war strategy against Iran and Hezbollah, even as the region teeters on wider escalation.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>In Beirut, Trump&#8217;s envoys Tom Barrack and Morgan Ortagus (calling themselves &#8220;beauty and the beast&#8221;) pitched an &#8220;economic zone&#8221; in south Lebanon backed by U.S. and Gulf investment in exchange for Hezbollah&#8217;s disarmament. They said Israel would withdraw from Lebanese territory &#8220;step by step&#8221; only in parallel with Lebanon&#8217;s plan to dismantle Hezbollah. Barrack called this a &#8220;cadence,&#8221; with details revealed only once Beirut submits a formal plan by the end of August. Ortagus hailed Lebanon&#8217;s August 5 decision to consolidate weapons under state control as &#8220;historic,&#8221; but insisted &#8220;it&#8217;s not about words, now it&#8217;s about action.&#8221; The envoys framed Hezbollah&#8217;s arms as an Iranian project to be replaced by Gulf and U.S. capital, claiming 40,000 fighters could be integrated into a new economic system. Barrack also lashed out at Lebanese reporters, calling them &#8220;animalistic&#8221; and &#8220;uncivilized,&#8221; remarks widely condemned as racist and condescending, consistent with Washington&#8217;s policy of dictating Lebanon&#8217;s future.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), visiting Beirut with Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) and Rep. Joe Wilson (R-SC), echoed the Trump administration&#8217;s line, telling Lebanese reporters: &#8220;Don&#8217;t ask me any questions about what Israel is going to do until you disarm Hezbollah.&#8221; Graham pressed Lebanon to dismantle its main defense force against Israel&#8217;s near-daily strikes and continuing occupation of five outposts in the south, offering only the prospect of a U.S.&#8211;Lebanon defense pact if Hezbollah is disarmed. His remarks drew anger as coercive and arrogant, ignoring Lebanon&#8217;s losses of nearly 4,000 dead, 16,000 wounded, and 1.2 million displaced during Israel&#8217;s 2024 invasion.</p></li></ul><h2>More From Drop Site</h2><ul><li><p>Midterms are upon us, which means the fight inside the Democratic Party over its role in the unfolding Israeli genocide and its allegiance to the U.S. oligarchy have a forum in the form of party primaries.

the U.S. oligarchy have a forum in the form of party primaries.

One of those contests appears to be in Maine, where a new Democratic Senate candidate, oysterman Graham Platner, has called out American complicity in the Gaza genocide and vowed to take on the billionaire class. His Republican opponent, incumbent Sen.

Angie Craig is facing populist Lt. Gov. <a href="https://x.com/peggyflanagan/status/1919708865689522544">Peggy Flanagan</a>. The big campaign event up there is the State Fair, and Craig missed the opening day, apparently to be in Jackson Hole hobnobbing with the crypto crowd. She<a href="https://www.cryptoinamerica.com/p/fed-takes-big-step-to-ease-crypto"> was the only elected Democrat to speak, and she warmed up the crowd for Eric Trump</a>, who spoke just after her. Tim Scott, the head of the GOP&#8217;s Senate reelection efforts, made news there by <a href="https://punchbowl.news/article/senate/scott-brown/">thanking the industry for defeating populist Sherrod Brown</a> in Ohio&#8217;s 2024 election. (He may now be running again.)</p><p>The crypto industry spent<a href="https://www.axios.com/local/twin-cities/2024/10/15/fairshake-crypto-spending-minnesota-campaign-angie-craig"> nearly $1 million</a> last cycle backing Craig. Flanagan rallied with Sen. Elizabeth Warren last week, the bane of crypto&#8217;s existence.</p><h3><strong>Wesley Bell and Cori Bush Eye Rematch</strong></h3><p>In St. Louis, AIPAC spent more than $10 million last cycle to oust Cori Bush, who was one of the early, leading critics of Israel&#8217;s genocide. A recent <a href="https://x.com/ryangrim/status/1958565929937227840">town hall descended into chaos</a> as Wesley Bell&#8217;s security and local police beat constituents who challenged Bell over his support of the genocide. (Bell&#8217;s allies tried to deny that the assailant in the green shirt was with Bell, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?mibextid=wwXIfr&amp;v=2549037992118662&amp;rdid=MAuUU0EmvczFsRLK">but here&#8217;s video of the man getting into a car with Bell after the event</a>.)</p><p>Now, Bell is out defending his acceptance of so much AIPAC money, <a href="https://x.com/DropSiteNews/status/1960347367913189423">speaking to a nearly empty room</a>:</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>If people wanna support what we&#8217;re doing, hey, we&#8217;ll take it, because we gotta get our message out, and the bottom line is, in our politics, you know they are expecting a couple billion dollars in these elections coming out, and so that money is flowing everywhere and until we address that issue and get campaign finance reform, <strong>if you want representation that&#8217;s gonna represent your district, those people can&#8217;t just go in there with empty pockets and just hopes and dreams. We gotta understand there&#8217;s a game being played. </strong>Politics is a game that&#8217;s being played and we can be righteous and say, Nah, we not gonna do it that way, and we can keep losing. And you know what? That&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve been doing.</p></blockquote></blockquote><h3><strong>Casar v. Doggett Match Averted</strong></h3><p>In Texas, Republican redistricting has attempted to cram Democrats into primaries against each other, and a backroom fight played out in Texas. Austin Rep. Greg Casar, the chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus and a critic of Israel, was jammed in with Texas icon Lloyd Doggett, who initially said he&#8217;d run no matter what Casar did, pointing to his $6 million war chest. His first mistake came when he suggested that Casar should run in a different district, because he was Hispanic and so were many of the voters&#8212;a tone-deaf move that inspired fence-sitting Texas pols to voice public support for Casar. Then David Hogg, who was booted out of the DNC over his plans to support lefty challengers to incumbent Democrats, vowed that he would raise and spend outside money to back Casar dollar-for-dollar against Doggett. Seeing the writing on the wall, Doggett announced he&#8217;d instead be running in a Republican-leaning district. That&#8217;s great news for Democrats, as Doggett may actually be able to win there, and it means Casar more than likely returns to Washington.</p><h3><strong>Adelson Money Flooding Dem Texas Senate Race</strong></h3><p>Texas Democrat James Talarico, a state House member running for Senate, has been showered <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/08/21/james-talarico-miriam-adelson-billionaire-donations-00517288">with money by Miriam Adelson, </a>one of Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu&#8217;s most generous financial backers. She also funds the free paper Israel Hayom, which is considered in Israel effectively to be Netanyahu&#8217;s newspaper. Talarico is facing Colin Allred, a former NFL linebacker and member of Congress who has regularly voted to arm Israel, but doesn&#8217;t take money from Adelson. (She gave at least a million dollars to Allred&#8217;s 2024 opponent, Ted Cruz.)</p><h3><strong>Allentown</strong></h3><p>In Lehigh Valley, Pennsylvania, a left-center battle is playing out. Pittsburgh populist Chris DeLuzio and Sen. Bernie Sanders <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/08/26/bob-brooks-firefighter-pa07-dem-launch-00523842?nid=0000014f-1646-d88f-a1cf-5f46b7bd0000&amp;nname=playbook&amp;nrid=9acfa65b-3bdc-4a6e-a960-66ca9dc206a3">have gotten behind the head of the local firefighter union leader, Bob Brooks,</a> who is squaring off against a centrist candidate backed by groups like EMILY&#8217;s List, a political action committee that works to elect Democratic pro-choice women.</p><p class="button-wrapper"

The firm pioneered the hair-on-fire fundraising tactics that often send more money to political consultants than to political candidates.</p><p>Mothership was recently<a href="https://data4democracy.substack.com/p/the-mothership-vortex-an-investigation"> the subject of yet another viral investigation</a> that revealed that of the $678 million the company&#8217;s core political action committees raised since 2018, just $11 million went to candidates; $159 million made its way to Mothership Strategies. Meanwhile, the firm&#8217;s spammy approach to email and text messaging&#8212;mock overdue bills, sky-is-falling rhetoric, and so on&#8212;has left the grassroots commons desiccated, draining email fundraising of its potency and driving many campaigns toward SMS (which is in the process of being destroyed itself).</p><p>Most fundraising firms, in order to find business, pitch themselves to political action committees (PACs) and to candidates. Mothership does that, but also innovated on the notion by simply making its own PACs and then turning them into clients. As long as the PACs spend some of the money they raise on political purposes&#8212;contributions to candidates, canvassing operations, producing ads, and so on&#8212;they are perfectly legal enterprises.</p><p>Now, Mothership has pointed its money vacuum at the Maine Senate race, a true motherlode for fundraising consultants: In 2020, Democrat Sara Gideon raised just under $75 million directly to her campaign before losing to Collins. Yes, $75 million. Outside groups raised and <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/summary?cycle=2020&amp;id=MES2">spent another $55 million</a> to boost her or attack Collins, and Gideon even finished with more than $10 million unspent in the bank. Collins and the Republican side raised and spent an equivalent fortune. Even a reasonable percentage of that haul adds up to a small treasure trove, and Mothership has never been accused of taking too small of a cut.</p><p>The candidate is named Jordan Wood, and he&#8217;s been executive director of two PACs in the Mothership ecosystem. His husband, Jake Lipsett, is a co-founder of Mothership and remains a partner. After Gideon&#8217;s loss, in 2021, Wood and Lipsett bought a <a href="https://lincolncountydemocrats.com/bristols-chris-hall-accepts-frances-perkins-award/">4,000-sq.-ft. lakeside home</a> in Bristol, Maine, for $2.15 million&#8212;now valued at more than $3 million. &#8220;Jordan was born and raised in Lewiston, Maine, and always dreamed of moving home to Maine to raise his family. When Jake and Jordan began planning to start their family, they moved home to Maine,&#8221; said Sarah McCarthy, a campaign spokesperson for Wood&#8217;s campaign.</p><p>Out of the gate, Wood was<a href="https://www.facebook.com/turnoutpac/posts/progressive-turnout-project-is-proud-to-support-jordan-wood-for-us-senate-jordan/1036679028644945/"> quickly endorsed by Progressive Turnout Project</a>, and<a href="https://wedefendthevote.org/endorsements/"> Defend the Vote</a>&#8212;both PACs use Mothership for their fundraising, a firm widely derided for their predatory fundraising tactics and minimal level of genuine political activity. In 2019,<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-a-little-known-democratic-firm-cashed-in-on-the-wave-of-midterm-money/2019/01/08/f91b04bc-fef5-11e8-862a-b6a6f3ce8199_story.html"> the Washington Post reported </a>that Mothership&#8217;s &#8220;lightning-quick rise also has sparked consternation in Democratic circles, where Mothership is sometimes derided as the &#8216;M-word,&#8217; because of its aggressive and sometimes misleading tactics.&#8221;</p><p>Defend the Vote, since launching in the 2020 cycle, has raised and spent just over $11 million, according to FEC records. Of that total, $3.8 million has gone to Mothership. Spending well over 30 percent of a total organization&#8217;s budget on a single fundraising consultant is considered highly unusual. PTP, meanwhile, has raised and spent more than $310 million since its launch in 2015. Of that total, $39 million went to Mothership.</p><p>Even that large number is deceiving, however, as FEC records show PTP got nearly $90 million of its cash from &#8220;affiliated committees.&#8221; Those committees use Mothership for their fundraising and then move the money to PTP. A budget of PTP&#8217;s size&#8212;the organization raised $90.3 million for the 2024 cycle&#8212;would typically make a political organization a significant player in Democratic politics, but Progressive Turnout Project has left barely any visible footprint outside of your email inbox. (Go search for &#8220;progressive turnout project&#8221; in your inbox, you probably get their emails.) A spokesperson for PTP rejected that characterization. &#8220;Mothership Strategies has helped power our efforts since day one. The funds we've spent on our digital fundraising program have allowed us to become the largest Democratic field organization in the country other than the presidential campaign,&#8221; said PTP.</p><p>The two PACs have already deployed their massive email lists in the service of fundraising for Wood, whose campaign said he has already raised more than $2 million. From a political perspective, the early endorsements were puzzling, as 77-year-old Maine Gov. Janet Mills has yet to decide whether to run, which had the effect of largely freezing the field of candidates. The PACs endorsed before knowing who else would run. In the meantime, a new insurgent candidate, oysterman and veteran Graham Platner<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/19/us/politics/maine-senate-candidate-collins.html"> has emerged as a credible challenger</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/19/us/politics/maine-senate-candidate-collins.html">running on a platform of taking on the billionaires on behalf of the working class</a>.</p><p>A spokesperson for Wood said that his campaign would not work with Mothership. &#8220;Jordan for Maine has not, and will not, hire Jordan&#8217;s husband's firm; we are working with a competitor,&#8221; said McCarthy, the spokesperson for Wood&#8217;s campaign. &#8220;Jordan is running for Senate because he believes our representatives should be accountable to regular folks, not billionaires or the elites, which is why he won&#8217;t take a dime from corporate PACs or lobbyists.&#8221;</p><p>Wood began as the political director for End Citizens United, which was birthed by Mothership in 2015 as a campaign-finance reform project. Wood helped get it off the ground, becoming its finance and PAC director in November 2015, and later its political director and vice president, leaving in January 2020, according to an ECU spokesperson. While Wood was there, ECU paid Mothership more than $9 million while raising $73 million, the spokesperson said. The Wood campaign said Wood recused himself from ECU&#8217;s dealings with Mothership once he and Lipsett began dating.</p><p>The PAC eventually became independent of Mothership&#8212;completely cutting ties in 2023. (Notably, while Defend the Vote has endorsed Wood for Senate, ECU has not, despite the fact that he served as its executive director, strengthening ECU&#8217;s claim to independence from the Mothership network.)</p><p>In the 2022 cycle, the Mothership ecosystem grew, with the advent of a new PAC, democracyFIRST PAC, which made Wood executive director <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/02/23/porter-list-fire-sale-00143018">in September 2022</a>. Wood stepped down in April 2025 to run for Senate, while Lipsett remains a partner at Mothership, which now boasts on its website of having raised nearly a billion for clients.</p><p>The PAC under Wood&#8217;s leadership did not initially hire Mothership for email fundraising and, instead, relied instead on a handful of major donors, including $3.5 million the first cycle from philanthropist Lynn Schusterman.

We're proud of the work democracyFIRST has done on the ground electing pro-democracy candidates with field support in key battleground states like Pennsylvania, and Progressive Turnout Project wanted to ensure that work would continue into the 2026 cycle. democracyFIRST and Progressive Turnout Project were two of the only organizations to provide support to Pennsylvania State Senator James Malone in his upset special election victory in March. Currently, democracyFIRST is on pace to spend $1 million in field support for local elections in Pennsylvania this fall, and is preparing 2026 plans for Arizona, Michigan, Nevada, and Wisconsin.</p></blockquote><p>Progressive Turnout Project, meanwhile, is making Maine a &#8220;priority race,&#8221; it has announced on their site. Progressive Turnout Project, the sister PAC to Woods&#8217;s democracyFIRST PAC, is likely going to raise tens of millions of dollars from people hoping to oust Susan Collins, much of which will be funneled to Lipsett&#8217;s Mothership.</p><p>The leadership of the Democratic Party is well aware of the problem of spammy PACS, yet the problem has just gotten worse over time. In 2016, I edited an investigation by <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/end-citizens-united-pac-campaign-finance-reform_n_570e5308e4b0ffa5937da409">Paul Blumenthal at HuffPost </a>on Mothership and End Citizens United, which had gotten off the ground in March 2015. Along with Lipsett, Mothership Strategies was founded by two veterans of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gberlin/">Greg Berlin</a> and Charles Starnes, who had done online fundraising for the party&#8217;s organization in charge of electing Democrats to the House of Representatives. In its first year, Blumenthal reported, ECU raised $11 million but sent a third of it to fundraising consultants&#8212;including half a million to Mothership Strategies, more than the $458,500 it gave to endorsed candidates. The group would go on to build other PACs, including not only Progressive Turnout Project but also National Democratic Training Committee, Stop Republicans, and others. Mothership PACs pioneered the tactic of signing donors up automatically for recurring contributions, a practice that ActBlue, the party&#8217;s fundraising platform, eventually barred as deceptive.</p><p>In January 2019, with Mothership still humming, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-a-little-known-democratic-firm-cashed-in-on-the-wave-of-midterm-money/2019/01/08/f91b04bc-fef5-11e8-862a-b6a6f3ce8199_story.html">a Washington Post expos&#233;</a> took the network apart, highlighting the way money flowed from the network of PACs to Mothership, even remarking on the marriage between Wood and Lipsett. The Post reported that Progressive Turnout Project &#8220;raised $23 million during the 2018 election cycle. About $4 million&#8212;17 percent of their total expenditures&#8212;went to Mothership for email fundraising and voter persuasion.&#8221; The paper also reported that the couple&#8217;s Goldendoodle had been named after &#8220;West Wing&#8221; character C.J. Cregg.</p><p>In the wake of the report, candidate campaigns largely stopped using Mothership, but its ability to extract massive sums of money for its own PACs continued.</p><p>&#8220;Through 2024, Progressive Turnout Project and its affiliated organizations have supported 2,227 Democrats in competitive campaigns, raised more than $368 million from more than 2.4 million unique donors, and deployed 38,962 paid team members,&#8221; said a spokesperson for PTP. &#8220;These organizers helped make more than 190 million voter contact attempts at doors and through our innovative field programs.&#8221;</p><p>After leaving ECU, Wood served the 2020 cycle as chief of staff to Rep. Katie Porter, who is one of the party&#8217;s top online fundraising powerhouses. (She was <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/02/23/porter-list-fire-sale-00143018">criticized in 2024</a> for selling her list of donors as a cash grab during her unsuccessful run for Senate.)</p><p>In a roundabout way, many of the fundraising consultants will genuinely get money out of politics, syphoning political contributions from small donors, but never spending it on campaigns. That&#8217;s likely not exactly what voters have in mind.</p><p>Progressive Turnout Project, in a statement, said that it stands by its early endorsement of Wood. &#8220;We've been familiar with Jordan's work for years and we also understand the importance of fielding a strong competitor against an entrenched Republican incumbent as early as possible,&#8221; the statement read. &#8220;We believe Jordan continues to be the most formidable candidate to take on Susan Collins.&#8221;</p><p class="button-wrapper"

Gaza</h2><ul><li><p>Seventy-five Palestinians were killed and 370 injured over the past 24 hours, according to the tally by the Gaza Health Ministry, including 17 killed and 122 injured while seeking aid. Three more have died due to starvation and malnutrition, bringing the total number of confirmed deaths to 303, including 117 children. The total death toll from Israeli aggression has risen to 62,819 martyrs and 158,629 injuries since October 7, 2023.</p></li><li><p>Out of an expected 3,000 trucks, only 467 aid trucks entered the Gaza Strip over the past five days, according to a new report issued by Gaza&#8217;s Government Media Office, adding that the trucks were looted amid Israel&#8217;s policy of "engineering starvation and chaos.&#8221; The 30-day statistical report stated that only 2,654 trucks, out of the intended 18,000, arrived over the past month, representing less than 15% of the actual needs in the enclave. &#8220;We remind you that the Gaza Strip requires more than 600 trucks of various types of aid daily to meet the minimum needs of 2.4 million people,&#8221; the report continues, and &#8220;we hold the occupation and its allies fully responsible for the humanitarian catastrophe.&#8221;</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Israel issued a new forced displacement order for northern Gaza&#8217;s Jabaliya residents, according to Hind Khoudary reporting from Deir el-Balah. Jabaliya is an area already emptied by Israeli airstrikes and military presence, and Israeli forces continue to press for displaced Palestinians to move further south. Many are moving west toward the coast because they cannot afford to evacuate, Khoudary reports.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><a href="https://x.com/DropSiteNews/status/1960180724633608466">Reuters and the Associated Press</a> have formally demanded answers from Israeli officials after airstrikes on Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis killed five journalists, including contractors and freelancers working with the two outlets. In a joint letter, the news agencies condemned the strike on a protected civilian site, questioned the credibility of IDF investigations, and urged Israel to allow independent journalists access to Gaza while ensuring accountability and press protections under international law.</p></li><li><p>The UN also calls for answers and justice after Israel&#8217;s attacks on Nasser Hospital.&#8220;The Israeli authorities have in the past announced investigations in such killings&#8230;but these investigations need to yield results,&#8221; UN rights office spokesman Thameen Al-Kheetan told reporters in Geneva. &#8220;There needs to be justice. We haven&#8217;t seen results or accountability measures yet,&#8221; he added.</p></li><li><p>In an interview with Ryan Grim, <a href="https://x.com/DropSiteNews/status/1960175102634459377">Gaza Civil Defense spokesman</a> Mahmoud Basal described the immense risks his crews face, noting that 138 workers have been killed during the genocide but that their mission is humanitarian before salaries or anything else, he said. He recounted rescuing 50 people under drone fire in Tel al-Hawa, stressing that, despite six months without pay, not a single member has abandoned their work.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPhCf-hf1ak">Watch</a>: Krystal Ball debunks the Israeli claim that the UN fudged the metrics around declaring famine in Gaza. The notion that the Famine Review Committee manipulated its numbers originated with the Israeli X account, which said publicly that when it came to Somalia and Sudan, the IPC used a standard of 30 percent of malnourishment, whereas with Gaza, they used 15 percent, relying on a measurement known as MUAC, for &#8220;Mid-Upper Arm Circumference." To determine famine, as Krystal explains, officials prefer to take a detailed population survey of height and weight. When that&#8217;s not possible, measuring the depleting circumference of people&#8217;s arms is a substitute. Because the arm withers at a slower rate than the overall body, seeing a collapse of arm circumference is more alarming, which is why the threshold is set at 15 percent rather than 30 for that measurement. Her full breakdown is on Breaking Points.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Moayad Naeem Al-Saksak, a child with cancer, <a href="https://x.com/DropSiteNews/status/1960107239706132577">died after being prevented from leaving Gaza</a> for treatment, with his condition worsened by acute malnutrition and famine.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Drop Site&#8217;s <a href="https://x.com/DropSiteNews/status/1960017048526082195">Jeremy Scahill</a> told Al Jazeera English that Israel is &#8220;systematically murdering the witnesses to its genocide,&#8221; including the five journalists killed at Nasser Hospital, calling it &#8220;a mass murder campaign being waged by a serial killer masquerading as a nation state.&#8221; He added that he has &#8220;never been more ashamed of our profession&#8221; as Western media continue to dehumanize Palestinians and justify the killing of their colleagues.</p></li></ul><h2>Ceasefire Negotiations and Israeli News</h2><ul><li><p>Thirteen Palestinians were released Saturday from Israel&#8217;s notorious <a href="https://x.com/DropSiteNews/status/1960116400468484258">Sde Teiman torture camp</a>, where detainees report having to endure beatings, &#8220;disco torture&#8221; that weaponizes loud music and creates sleep deprivation, and deliberate medical neglect. Survivors, including a tearful young boy, urged the world to &#8220;save the remaining detainees,&#8221; as human rights groups highlight 77 Palestinian deaths since October 2023 from systemic abuse and mistreatment.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Israel&#8217;s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the deadly strike on Nasser Hospital a &#8220;mishap,&#8221; expressing apparent regret, while Israeli soldiers told Channel 14 it was deliberate, approved, and coordinated with senior command. Golani Brigade troops claimed they targeted a &#8220;Hamas-operated&#8221; surveillance camera at the site, describing it as a &#8220;terror target,&#8221; contradicting the IDF spokesperson&#8217;s preliminary inquiry and public statements of regret.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Ceasefire talks in Gaza have stalled as Trump promised a <a href="https://x.com/DropSiteNews/status/1960043953102770316">&#8220;conclusive ending&#8221;</a> within weeks, claiming the genocide will soon be over. Meanwhile, Israel&#8217;s Channel 13 reports Netanyahu has declined to respond to the latest Hamas-accepted ceasefire proposal, instead exploring the possibility of occupying Gaza and focusing on a &#8220;comprehensive&#8221; plan for all captives, sidelining the current U.S.-mediated framework. Read Jeremy Scahill&#8217;s <a href="https://www.dropsitenews.com/p/hamas-israel-gaza-ceasefire-concessions-negotiations-netanyahu-trump">reporting on the current framework here.</a></p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Palestinian-Israeli lawmaker Ayman Odeh, frequently expelled from the Knesset for condemning Israel&#8217;s actions in Gaza, slammed Netanyahu over the Nasser Hospital airstrike declaring: &#8220;You are a liar to the core of your soul.&#8221;</p></li></ul><h2>West Bank</h2><ul><li><p>Israeli forces injured at least 24 people during their ongoing raid in central Ramallah and Al-Bireh in the occupied West Bank, according to the Wafa news agency. Among those injured is a 71-year-old man hit by rubber bullets and a 12-year-old child shot in the back near the local market.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>The <a href="https://x.com/DropSiteNews/status/1960211812902662398">Jenin Camp Media Committee</a> reports that after 217 days of continuous assault, Israeli forces have destroyed 70% of the camp, bulldozed over 650 buildings, and displaced nearly 22,000 residents. Infrastructure collapse, halted UNRWA services, and ongoing detentions by both Israeli and Palestinian Authority forces have left residents without medical care and under harsh conditions.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>The family of 16-year-old Palestinian American <a href="https://x.com/DropSiteNews/status/1960126380332683474">Mohammed Zaher Ibrahim</a>, who is being held without trial in an Israeli prison, says his lawyer is still negotiating with the prosecutor and social media pressure, along with demands from U.S. officials, remain their strongest leverage, as the court appears reluctant to act.</p></li></ul><h2>U.S. News</h2><ul><li><p>On Sunday, Trump threatened to send the military into <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-threatens-military-baltimore-crime-key-bridge-funding-chicago-rcna226846">Baltimore</a> to &#8220;quickly clean up&#8221; crime, citing the D.C. National Guard deployment as a precedent, while also warning he might pull federal funding for Maryland infrastructure projects like rebuilding the collapsed Francis Scott Key Bridge. Maryland officials&#8212;including Governor Wes Moore, lawmakers, and local leaders&#8212;condemned Trump&#8217;s threats as illegal, politically motivated, and counterproductive, noting that Baltimore&#8217;s crime rates have already declined and emphasizing the need for collaboration rather than military overreach.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Trump issued an executive order directing the Justice Department to investigate and prosecute individuals who <a href="https://x.com/DropSiteNews/status/1960129739198267723">burn the American flag</a>. The order calls for one-year prison sentences and instructs Attorney General Pam Bondi to challenge Supreme Court protections for flag burning as free speech.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Trump is expanding the U.S. government&#8217;s involvement in private companies, following a nearly <a href="https://x.com/DropSiteNews/status/1960151809407799635">10% stake acquisition in Intel</a>, which his National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett called a &#8220;down payment&#8221; on a future sovereign wealth fund. Trump hailed the Intel deal on social media as a win for taxpayers, while Sen. Bernie Sanders said it&#8217;s reasonable for the government to benefit when companies receive generous federal grants.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Congressman. Ritchie Torres urged Biden to speed shipments of bombs to Israel, voted for a $17 billion arms package, and <a href="https://readsludge.com/2025/08/25/torres-invested-in-weapons-makers-as-he-backed-billions-in-arms-for-israel/">secretly bought stock in defense contractors</a> Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, and L3Harris&#8212;the companies supplying Israel&#8217;s arsenal. He filed the trades nearly a year late, far past the STOCK Act&#8217;s 45-day deadline, Sludge reports. Meanwhile, he opposed a ceasefire, joined Republicans to override Biden&#8217;s brief pause on 2,000-pound bombs, and voted to sanction the ICC after it issued arrest warrants for Israeli leaders.</p></li></ul><h2>International News</h2><ul><li><p>Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa confirmed <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-said-to-close-in-on-security-deal-with-syria-as-us-envoy-meets-netanyahu/">&#8220;advanced&#8221; talks with Israel</a> on a security agreement with Israel, reportedly based on the preexisting 1974 disengagement agreement between the two countries signed at the end of the Yom Kippur war. The details of the emerging agreement are disputed, with Israel&#8217;s Channel 12 reporting that it would include demilitarizing the Golan Heights, preventing Syrian military restoration, and establishing a humanitarian corridor in exchange for U.S. and Gulf support. Al Majalla and Syria&#8217;s SANA news agency have instead reported that the deal will focus strictly on deescalation and not include an imminent normalization of ties.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>The U.S. has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-orders-more-ships-southern-caribbean-with-eye-drug-cartels-sources-say-2025-08-25/">dispatched additional warships</a>, including the USS Lake Erie and USS Newport News, to the southern Caribbean as part of Trump&#8217;s increasingly militarized approach to Latin American drug cartels.

husband feeding their twins Tawfiq and Naya in July 2025. (Photo: Amr Tabash)</figcaption></figure></div><p>GAZA CITY&#8212;Joud Zourab, a young woman in Gaza who spent nearly five years struggling with infertility, had been waiting with anticipation for the day of October 10, 2023. That was the date that she and her husband had secured a long-awaited appointment for an in vitro fertilization procedure (IVF) that they hoped would allow them to finally start their family.</p><p>The appointment never took place. The ensuing devastation from Israel&#8217;s retaliation against Hamas and the concurrent siege on Gaza meant permanent cancellation of her fertility treatment. Days into the war, the medical center where her treatment was scheduled was bombed. Remaining medical facilities inside Gaza&#8212;where elective treatments like IVF were expensive and time-consuming even before the war&#8212;would soon be overwhelmed with huge numbers of wounded and dying people.</p><p>Zourab and her husband were displaced from their home by the bombing. Yet, against all odds, four months after her IVF procedure had been scheduled, they managed to conceive naturally.</p><p>After a painful pregnancy in which she endured anemia, calcium deficiency, and other adverse health impacts caused by malnutrition, forced displacement, and exposure to the elements, Zourab gave birth to twins named Tawfiq and Naya in November 2024. Today, they are being raised in a tent in an area under displacement orders by the Israeli military, with even their short-term living conditions uncertain. Zourab describes her children as &#8220;everything beautiful in my life, my blessing from God.&#8221; But she cannot shake the guilt of raising them in such unsafe and unhealthy conditions&#8212;without medical care, without clean water, and often without food.</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.dropsitenews.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Subscribe to Drop Site News.</p></div><form class="subscription-widget-subscribe"><input type="email" class="email-input" name="email" placeholder="Type your email&#8230;" tabindex="-1"><input type="submit" class="button primary" value="Subscribe"><div class="fake-input-wrapper"><div class="fake-input"></div><div class="fake-button"></div></div></form></div></div><p>In a recent interview with Al Jazeera, Dr. Munir Alborsh, the director general of the Ministry of Health in Gaza, emphasized that beyond the physical devastation, Israel has launched a psychological war on pregnant women&#8212;whose number he estimates to be around 60,000 inside Gaza today. He explained that this strategy aims to instill fear among Gazans, while pushing them toward demographic collapse.</p><p>Zourab&#8217;s experience, alongside many other pregnant and nursing women inside Gaza, shows how pregnant women and the next generation of children have already been impacted by the violence, famine, and medical deprivation inflicted on the territory. In July, the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), a UN agency focused on global reproductive and maternal health, decried what it called &#8220;catastrophic&#8221; conditions for pregnant women in the territory, noting that Gaza&#8217;s birthrate had plummeted 41 percent over the past three years.</p><p>That decline itself is a component of Israel&#8217;s genocide against the Palestinian population. While Israeli leaders have made frequent statements about the alleged demographic threat posed by newborn Palestinian children in territories under their occupation, the UN&#8217;s official definition of genocide states that &#8220;implementing measures to prevent births&#8221; is part of the calculated destruction of a people. An article <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)01627-7/fulltext">published</a> this week in the medical journal The Lancet noted that in addition to the 17,000 live births recorded by the Ministry of Health in Gaza in the first six months of 2025, 2,600 pregnancies ended in miscarriage, 220 resulted in intrauterine fetal deaths, and 21 newborns died within 24 hours of birth.</p><p>Highlighting the impact of widespread food shortages on pregnant mothers living through famine in Gaza, the article added that, &#8220;premature births, congenital malformations, and low birthweight have become commonplace, as pregnant mothers face malnutrition and repeated forced displacement.&#8221; In addition, Israeli military bombardment had forced the Palestinian population to, &#8220;coalesce into tent cities where water is scarce, sanitation rudimentary, and caloric intake insufficient,&#8221; further compounding health risks to those most vulnerable.</p><p>Zourab and her husband were forced to flee four times while she was pregnant, and three more times after she gave birth. After the twins were born, she had nothing to eat but lentil soup. The twins were born severely underweight&#8212;just 2.2 pounds and 3.3 pounds respectively. She struggled to keep them warm inside a fragile tent. Malnutrition robbed her of the ability to breastfeed. Her milk dried up. Her ordeal deepened: finding infant formula for two newborns became nearly impossible. With shortages and skyrocketing prices, the family&#8217;s desperation grew.</p><p>Before the genocide, Zourab worked as a photographer, and her husband ran a small barbershop. They lived a modest but stable life. Now, inflation and soaring prices have drained every bit of their savings. She says she received no institutional support throughout her pregnancy, or afterward. Border closures and aid restrictions left her entirely on her own. Today, her daughter has lost weight because the family cannot afford enough formula. A single can&#8212;now costing around $70&#8212;must be stretched over ten days. The babies are only given milk at night, while during the day, she feeds them lentils. But her daughter cannot tolerate lentils, which has worsened her malnutrition.</p><p>Diapers, once basic necessities, now cost about $150 per pack. The family does everything they can, but their children often suffer from diarrhea and fevers caused by poor nutrition and contaminated food. Raising two infants in a tent surrounded by bombing, chaos, and fear has left Zourab exhausted. Hygiene is almost impossible.

(Photo: Amr Tabash)</figcaption></figure></div><h2><strong>&#8220;An Unbearable Weight&#8221;</strong></h2><p>Following a decision by the Israeli government to resume limited aid supplies to Gaza this May, Moshe Feiglin, an Israeli politician and former deputy speaker of the Knesset, denounced the move, specifically naming Palestinian children, including babies, as the enemy.</p><p>&#8220;Every child in Gaza is the enemy. And I&#8217;ll tell you more than that. Every child, every baby in Gaza is the enemy,&#8221; Feigslin said in an interview with Channel 14. He added that, &#8220;Every child that you are now giving milk to will rape your daughters and slaughter your children in 15 years.&#8221;</p><p>Safaa Al-Amsi was five months pregnant with her first child when the genocide began. Forced to live through bombardment and fear, in February 2024, while displaced from her home to southern Gaza by Israeli military operations, she gave birth to a son whom she named Sufyan. &#8220;He was as radiant as the moon,&#8221; she said, but her joy was short-lived. Sufyan survived only a month and a half.</p><p>One night, as he was being nursed at home, Sufyan&#8217;s health suddenly worsened. She rushed him to Kamal Adwan Hospital in Beit Lahia for a diagnosis and in hopes of finding treatment. The hospital, she described, was overwhelmed and lacking hygiene, staff, and basic care equipment. Amid it all, an outbreak of hepatitis spread among the patients. Sufyan never received care for his undiagnosed illness, which al-Amsi believes stemmed from an infection, and passed away as a result. His death, she said, left a wound in her heart that will never heal.</p><p>Five months later, she became pregnant again. Her second pregnancy, she recalled, was among the most harrowing experiences she has ever endured. She was unable to nourish her body after her first pregnancy, deprived of even the simplest food like milk or eggs. Her suffering deepened with constant displacement from one shelter to another. Exhaustion, she explained, consumed her body and spirit. She endured nights of unrelenting pain&#8212;even her teeth decayed&#8212;yet treatment was impossible.</p><p>With patience, al-Amsi eventually delivered her baby girl, Rania, in June. Her daughter&#8217;s birth, too, was accompanied by suffering. The cesarean delivery was agonizing, performed without pain relief or proper medical care, in an environment where food and comfort were absent. Weak and malnourished, al-Amsi found her ability to breastfeed impaired. Her milk, she said, was too thin to satisfy her baby. To make matters worse, Rania was born with an enlarged kidney pelvis and needed infant formula, but no hospital could provide it. Volunteer doctors who have traveled to Gaza on medical missions have told Drop Site that baby formula is one of the items that have been confiscated from them by Israeli authorities before entry.</p><p>&#8220;Every day, my pain grows as I see her hungry,&#8221; al-Amsi said. &#8220;I starve alongside her, nursing her from an empty body.&#8221;</p><p>Unable to afford diapers, al-Amsi resorted to cloth strips and nylon bags. These makeshift solutions have caused rashes and wounds on Rania&#8217;s tender skin, and al-Amsi&#8217;s heart broke as she watched her baby suffer. The hardship extended beyond food and medicine. Just a week after giving birth, she was displaced again, still bearing the fresh wounds of surgery. She described each step of that flight as a battle with death itself.</p><p>Today, al-Amsi&#8217;s life remains consumed by the cries of her infant daughter. &#8220;Whenever my baby cries from pain or hunger, I cry with her,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I feel as though I am on the verge of collapse, crushed by an unbearable weight and a suffocating sense of helplessness.&#8221;</p><h2><strong>Famine Deprivation</strong></h2><p>Khadija al-Laham, the mother of a two-month-old boy named Mohammad, experienced a similar ordeal as a pregnant woman during the war. Her suffering was compounded by the fact that her child was born at the height of the current famine.<strong><br><br></strong>Al-Laham suffered from gestational diabetes during her pregnancy, without even the most basic necessities or adequate food. She delivered her baby in June 2025 via cesarean section, and he weighed less than 2 kilograms (4.4 pounds) at birth. After giving birth, she could not stay in the hospital to receive further treatment and nurse him to health, as Nasser Hospital was under threat of evacuation due to Israeli attacks.</p><p>Al-Laham said that shortly after her son&#8217;s cesarean birth, she found nothing to eat except a small pack of sweets, barely enough to ease her hunger. Her husband had been injured a month earlier while attempting to fetch food from an aid distribution site. She adds, tearfully, that life in a tent after childbirth is harder than one can imagine: the bathroom is far away, the sand is uncomfortable, and the difficulty of giving birth becomes even harsher without proper shelter.</p><p>Like many other nursing Palestinian women who spoke with Drop Site, al-Laham also has had difficulty breastfeeding. As a result of her own malnutrition, she has difficulty producing adequate milk, and her baby continues to cry from hunger. Infant formula is extremely expensive, and even if she could find it, she cannot afford it. No organization or institution is currently providing support for nursing mothers.</p><p>She continues to describe her struggle to afford basic baby supplies. She must keep her baby in the same diaper all day due to exorbitant prices. She also struggles to feed her five other children, especially since her husband was injured. Yet what breaks her heart most is her infant Mohammad. She lives every moment in fear that he may succumb to the extreme heat that they experience inside their tent during the summer.</p><h2><strong>Born to a World of Fear</strong></h2><p>For pregnant women in Gaza&#8212;instead of living in environments that allow them space for comfort and joy, where they can have time to pamper themselves, enjoy spa treatments, paint their nails, and immerse themselves in the simple pleasures of life while preparing for motherhood&#8212;the experience of pregnancy has degraded into one of unrelenting pain, uncertainty, and deprivation.</p><p>The impact of Israel&#8217;s calculated policy of inflicting harm on the most vulnerable civilians through aid restrictions will likely be felt for generations. Babies who lack proper nutrition in their first thousand days are at risk of stunted growth, weakened immunity, and impaired brain development. This means that even if they survive today, many may grow up with learning difficulties, chronic health problems, and reduced opportunities in adulthood. In Gaza, where access to food, clean water, and medical care is so scarce, an entire generation of children is at risk of being permanently scarred&#8212;their futures stolen from them in infancy.</p><p>To listen to Joud, Safaa, and Khadija is to confront the truth that motherhood in Gaza is not celebrated; it is survived.</p><p class="button-wrapper"

Political leaders, including Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvir, pressed for a rapid operation using siege tactics, while Chief of Staff Eyal Zamir warned that forcibly displacing 1 million people would take time, with Netanyahu and Ron Dermer citing Trump&#8217;s demand for a swift, decisive outcome.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><a href="https://x.com/DropSiteNews/status/1959728878202519986">Dr. Mohammed Abu Salmiya</a>, director general of Al-Shifa Medical Complex, warned that only six hospitals in Gaza City are partially operating, with children in incubators and dialysis patients at risk of death if evacuation is enforced. He described worsening malnutrition and medicine shortages. He added that the Israeli occupation is using unknown gases, and cases of suffocation reach hospitals daily. Dr. Salmiya called for urgent international and Arab intervention to stop the genocide and humanitarian crisis in Gaza.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Israel is reportedly planning for the damaged <a href="https://x.com/DropSiteNews/status/1959410826323869852">European Hospital</a> in Khan Younis to act as a replacement for Gaza City hospitals as it prepares to seize the city, but Gaza&#8217;s Health Ministry says the facility is severely devastated and far from operational. With over 2,000 patients still trapped in Gaza City hospitals, officials warn that an invasion would trigger a &#8220;new massacre,&#8221; and rebuilding the European Hospital would take months and millions of dollars even under ideal conditions.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Residents in Sheikh Radwan, Al-Jalaa, and Jabalia Al-Nazla, north of Gaza City, have been advised to cover their faces with water-soaked masks after Israeli forces detonated <a href="https://x.com/DropSiteNews/status/1959417712901283913">booby-trapped robots</a>, releasing gases that caused severe breathing difficulties.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Gaza faces a <a href="https://x.com/DropSiteNews/status/1959668668335640582">critical shelter crisis</a>, with a 96% shortfall leaving southern governorates unable to accommodate 1.3 million displaced people.

Another Senior Hamas Official <a href="https://x.com/DropSiteNews/status/1959758270052102599">Dr. Basem Naim</a> said Israel has rejected all partial and comprehensive ceasefire offers, accusing Netanyahu&#8217;s government of stalling while escalating the Gaza conflict with U.S. support. He urged the international community&#8212;especially Arab and Islamic nations&#8212;to bypass the U.S. veto at the UN.

That evening, pro-government supporters attacked demonstrators, throwing stones and frozen water bottles and targeting them with fireworks. The protestors retaliated, throwing objects back at Vu&#269;i&#263;&#8217;s supporters. The police did not intervene, though they were also struck several times.</p><p>These events sparked outrage, in part because the police stood by and allowed the violent attacks by Vu&#269;i&#263;&#8217;s supporters against the demonstrators, and on August 13, people in several Serbian cities protested in front of the ruling party&#8217;s offices. The police responded with force, and since then, clashes between protestors and police have continued across Serbia. Almost every night, the streets of the capital, Belgrade, and other Serbian cities are filled with police deploying tear gas and armored vehicles on one side, and regime opponents on the other.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.dropsitenews.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://www.dropsitenews.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p>The roots of the uprising stretch back to November 1, 2024, when a concrete canopy weighing over 300 tons collapsed at the railway station in Novi Sad, killing 16 people. This canopy had been officially reopened just four months earlier after reconstruction.</p><p>This tragic event sparked a wave of protests across Serbia, led by a segment of the population previously considered the most indifferent to social and political issues in the country&#8212;university students. They swiftly formed the core of a movement waging a campaign for accountability and against corruption and vowing to drive Vu&#269;i&#263; from power.</p><p>Arrests of protesters, particularly students, are ongoing.</p><p>Vu&#269;i&#263; has ruled Serbia for 13 years. A veteran of Serbian politics who served as information minister under the government of Slobodan Milo&#353;evi&#263; in the 1990s, Vu&#269;i&#263; is well known for his ability to calibrate his positions to maintain strategic alliances with both the U.S. and its adversaries. Although the country officially remains on the path to joining the European Union and enjoys warm relations with the Trump administration, Vu&#269;i&#263; also maintains close ties with Russia and China.</p><p>Vu&#269;i&#263; is conducting talks with the EU regarding the status of Kosovo, which formally declared independence from Serbia in 2008. His government sends weapons to both Ukraine and Israel and Belgrade <a href="https://www.jpost.com/defense-and-tech/article-864525">reportedly signed</a> a recent deal with the Israeli weapons technology firm Elbit Systems worth $1.6 billion for long-range rockets, drones, and surveillance systems. Rio Tinto&#8212;a powerful mining company that environmentalists accuse of causing pollution and other environmental damage in addition to allegations of mistreatment of workers&#8212;plans to open a mine in a lithium- and boron-rich area of Serbia called Jadar. Just over two months ago, the European Commission declared the Jadar project one of strategic importance for the EU.</p><p>Vu&#269;i&#263;&#8217;s opponents call him an autocrat and dictator, claiming that corruption in the country has never been higher. They cite as an example the cost of the Paris Olympics last year&#8212;&#8364;10 billion&#8212;and compare it with the projected costs for Serbia&#8217;s EXPO, scheduled to be held in Belgrade in 2027, which is expected to cost nearly &#8364;18 billion.</p><p>According to recent polls, Vu&#269;i&#263;&#8217;s popularity is on the decline and he has rejected calls for new elections, despite the country being in deep political crisis.</p><p>Du&#353;an &#268;avi&#263; and Du&#353;an &#352;aponja, cohosts of the popular Serbian YouTube documentary news program <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Marka%C5%BDvaka">Marka &#381;vaka</a> produced this report for Drop Site News explaining how Serbia once again has found itself at the political crossroads.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.dropsitenews.com/p/video-serbia-mass-protests-aleksandar-vucic?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://www.dropsitenews.com/p/video-serbia-mass-protests-aleksandar-vucic?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.dropsitenews.com/p/video-serbia-mass-protests-aleksandar-vucic/comments&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Leave a comment&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://www.dropsitenews.com/p/video-serbia-mass-protests-aleksandar-vucic/comments"><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Israel Is Forcing Parents in Gaza to Watch Their Children Die of Hunger]]></title><description><![CDATA[&#8220;Imagine looking at your child, and you can&#8217;t feed him.

(Screenshot of video by Abdel Qader Sabbah)</figcaption></figure></div><p>&#8220;We're living through extremely difficult days and a very harsh famine,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Jana is battling death. Her condition is extremely severe. She needs to be transferred abroad because there is no adequate treatment for what she&#8217;s experiencing.&#8221;</p><p>On Friday, the world&#8217;s leading authority on food crisis&#8212;the UN-backed Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC)&#8212;officially declared a full-blown, Phase 5 &#8220;catastrophic&#8221; famine in the governorate of Gaza, which includes Gaza City, a classification characterized by &#8220;starvation, destitution, and death.&#8221;</p><p>Aaed Abu Khater&#8217;s 13-year-old son, Atef, died from malnutrition earlier this month in Gaza City. &#8220;Atef was like the rest of the people, suffering from a lack of food and water,&#8221; Abu Khater told Drop Site. &#8220;Imagine looking at your child, and you can&#8217;t feed him. You can&#8217;t do anything for him&#8230;The most precious thing I had, my son, died of hunger.&#8221;</p><p>Without proper nutrients, including vegetables and protein, Atef&#8217;s weight dropped dramatically and his condition continued to deteriorate until he was no longer able to walk or move. Abu Khater carried him to hospital where he spent 18 days on IV fluids before being discharged due to a lack of beds. &#8220;When we were finally able to feed him, the hunger had exhausted him so much he could barely eat. He could barely chew potatoes and he couldn&#8217;t eat bread,&#8221; Abu Khater said.</p><p>During the three days he was back at home, two of Atef&#8217;s cousins were shot and killed in an aid massacre at the Zikim crossing. &#8220;You&#8217;re going to die either way. If you go to Zikim, you&#8217;ll die. If you stay in your tent, you&#8217;ll die. You&#8217;ll die from hunger, or you&#8217;ll be shot. It&#8217;s a trap,&#8221; Abu Khater said.</p><p>Atef was clearly dying at home, so his father prepared to take him back to the hospital. In the morning, as his mother washed him and got him ready to go, he died sitting in a chair. &#8220;If I showed you his picture when he was in middle school, Atef was tall, and I&#8217;d say his weight was around 60 kilograms. By the time we buried Atef, he was barely over 25 kilos. When we buried him, we did it in a small grave, about 50 centimeters wide, placed next to those of his uncles. He was a skeleton&#8212;just bones covered in skin,&#8221; Abu Khater said.</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.dropsitenews.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Drop Site News is reader-supported.

Deir al-Balah in central Gaza and Khan Younis in the south, which are currently classified as Phase 4&#8212;experiencing &#8220;emergency&#8221; hunger&#8212;are expected to officially be declared in a famine by September.</p><p>&#8220;As this famine is entirely man-made, it can be halted and reversed,&#8221; the IPC said. &#8220;The time for debate and hesitation has passed, starvation is present and is rapidly spreading. There should be no doubt in anyone&#8217;s mind that an immediate, at-scale response is needed. Any further delay&#8212;even by days&#8212;will result in a totally unacceptable escalation of Famine-related mortality.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;If a ceasefire is not implemented to allow humanitarian aid to reach everyone in the Gaza Strip,&#8221; the IPC emphasized, &#8220;and if essential food supplies, and basic health, nutrition, and WASH services are not restored immediately, avoidable deaths will increase exponentially.&#8221;</p><p>United Nations officials said in no uncertain terms that the famine in Gaza is a result of Israeli policy, with the UN High Commissioner on Human Rights Volker Turk calling it &#8220;the direct result of actions taken by the Israeli government&#8221; and adding, &#8220;It is a war crime to use starvation as a method of warfare, and the resulting deaths may also amount to the war crime of willful killing.&#8221;</p><p>Tom Fletcher, the under secretary-general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator said it was a &#8220;21st century famine, watched over by drones and the most advanced military technology in history&#8230;It is a famine on all of our watch. Everyone owns this, the Gaza famine is the world's famine."</p><p>Israel has imposed a harsh siege on Gaza for nearly two decades. Beginning in 2007, Israeli authorities mandated that Palestinians in the enclave should receive the minimum amount of food to avoid malnutrition, providing 37% fewer fruits and vegetables than the average Israeli has access to. </p><p>When Israel launched its genocidal assault in October 2023, it imposed a full-spectrum blockade, which eased and tightened over the course of the past 22 months. In March, Israel imposed the longest full-spectrum blockade of the war, with no aid entering Gaza for nearly three months. It dismantled the UN aid distribution system that was in place and, on May 27, it began allowing in a little amount of aid in a system overseen by the U.S., Europe and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, with just four distribution sites located in heavily militarized zones. Since then, over 2,000 starving Palestinians have been killed as they try to get food in aid massacres.</p><p>The forced starvation campaign reached a tipping point this summer. At least 273 people in Gaza have died of famine and malnutrition since the start of war, including 112 children. A staggering 86 of those starvation deaths&#8212;or 68% of the total&#8212;have occurred in the past month, according to a tally of Health Ministry figures. Absent a ceasefire and a massive influx of aid and medical treatment, many more are projected to die of hunger and malnutrition in the coming period.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!e2iS!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F44c51185-9204-47e9-bbf8-2a85901cc8d9_3020x1700.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!e2iS!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F44c51185-9204-47e9-bbf8-2a85901cc8d9_3020x1700.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!e2iS!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F44c51185-9204-47e9-bbf8-2a85901cc8d9_3020x1700.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!e2iS!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F44c51185-9204-47e9-bbf8-2a85901cc8d9_3020x1700.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!e2iS!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F44c51185-9204-47e9-bbf8-2a85901cc8d9_3020x1700.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!e2iS!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F44c51185-9204-47e9-bbf8-2a85901cc8d9_3020x1700.png" width="1456" height="820" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/44c51185-9204-47e9-bbf8-2a85901cc8d9_3020x1700.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:820,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:6576969,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.dropsitenews.com/i/171686896?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F44c51185-9204-47e9-bbf8-2a85901cc8d9_3020x1700.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!e2iS!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F44c51185-9204-47e9-bbf8-2a85901cc8d9_3020x1700.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!e2iS!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F44c51185-9204-47e9-bbf8-2a85901cc8d9_3020x1700.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!e2iS!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F44c51185-9204-47e9-bbf8-2a85901cc8d9_3020x1700.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!e2iS!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F44c51185-9204-47e9-bbf8-2a85901cc8d9_3020x1700.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Aaed Abu Khater, with his surviving son, Yahya, inside their tent in Gaza City.

Abu Khater was injured, one of his other sons was killed, and his youngest son was wounded with shrapnel in the eye. &#8220;One died from a bombing. Another died from hunger. Maybe another one will die from scabies, or disease, or the sewage, or from lack of hygiene. You go to sleep terrified, you don&#8217;t know where death is going to come from,&#8221; Abu Khater said. &#8220;There are hundreds, thousands going through the same thing. It&#8217;s repeating daily.&#8221;</p><p>Dr. Musab Farwana, a pediatrician in the Pediatric Department and Malnutrition Department at the Patient&#8217;s Friends Benevolent Society Hospital, told Drop Site that all medical facilities in Gaza have a dire lack of supplies.</p><p>&#8220;As a hospital, we lack baby formula, nutritional supplements, Cerelac, biscuits, and therapeutic food like peanut butter paste&#8212;all of which on its own is not enough. For children aged around one to one and a half years, we also need vegetables, meats, and proteins. Vegetables provide essential vitamins. This is something the entire population of Gaza, around 2.4 million people, is deprived of. We all lack these nutrients,&#8221; he said. </p><p>Inside the hospital, emaciated children and babies barely able to move lie in cots or sit with blank stares, drawn faces, and ribcages and spines poking out from their torsos.</p><div class="native-video-embed" data-component-name="VideoPlaceholder" data-attrs="{&quot;mediaUploadId&quot;:&quot;6b76c268-1d90-44e0-a741-1bb37b1c2611&quot;,&quot;duration&quot;:null}"></div><p><em>Inside the Patient&#8217;s Friends Benevolent Society Hospital in Gaza City. August 7, 2025. (Video by Abdel Qader Sabbah)</em></p><p>&#8220;We&#8217;re seeing children not only with malnutrition but also with severe dehydration due to the lack of clean drinking water. The cases are very critical. We are at risk of losing many children. If things continue like this and are not addressed urgently, the situation will worsen. We will lose more and more innocent lives&#8212;dozens, even hundreds of children.&#8221;</p><p>Madlalah Dawwas&#8217;s 9-year-old daughter, Maryam, is in danger of dying by starvation. A skeletal figure, she lay on a cot in the Patient&#8217;s Friends Benevolent Society Hospital, barely able to move. Dawwas told Drop Site she first began losing weight three months into the war as food became increasingly scarce. The family had been forcibly displaced to the south and Dawwas took her to several hospitals to be treated for malnutrition. During the ceasefire in January, when the amount of humanitarian aid allowed into Gaza significantly increased, Maryam&#8217;s condition improved.</p><p>&#8220;During the truce, Maryam improved by 80%. But when the truce ended and the war returned, the fear came back. Fruits and vegetables were cut off again, famine returned all over again&#8212;and I began to fear for Maryam again,&#8221; Dawwas said. &#8220;Maryam lost so many things she loved, and I couldn't provide them to her in this famine,&#8221; she said adding, &#8220;She would, open my phone sometimes and ask me to turn on the internet, because she loved watching food videos on YouTube&#8212;Western food videos, and the meals she liked.&#8221;</p><p>As she spoke, Dawwas reached over and used a syringe to insert a few drops of milk into her daughter&#8217;s mouth.</p><div class="native-video-embed" data-component-name="VideoPlaceholder" data-attrs="{&quot;mediaUploadId&quot;:&quot;9705d559-0b23-477e-9e17-73562cba1d62&quot;,&quot;duration&quot;:null}"></div><p><em>Madlalah Dawwas with her 9-year-old daughter, Maryam, in the Patient&#8217;s Friends Benevolent Society Hospital in Gaza City.

I just want to wake her&#8212;not to feed her or give her milk or change her diaper&#8212;just to make sure she&#8217;s still breathing. I always imagine she&#8217;s gone, but then I distract myself, try to focus on something else, and say: &#8216;No, thank God. God will not take her from me.&#8217; I just want Maryam to go back to how she used to be.&#8221;</p><p>The IPC report warns that the man-made famine is only projected to spread. &#8220;Increasing reports of malnutrition-related deaths indicate that the most vulnerable in society are beginning to succumb. This trend is expected to increase amongst vulnerable groups such as children, the elderly, and those with chronic diseases, before spreading to the wider population.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;The overall situation is no secret to anyone, including the entire world: Gaza is going through an extremely severe and man-made famine caused by the complete Israeli blockade on the Gaza Strip,&#8221; Dr. Farwana said. &#8220;We are a people who deserve life. A people who have been oppressed, wounded and abandoned by everyone, whether the Western world or the Islamic world. We are not being treated with basic human decency.
