      <p><strong>A man who was attacked by hyenas while he was sleeping at a bachelor party has revealed what saved his life.</strong></p><p>Nicolas Hohls, 27, was asleep in his tent at Cape Vidal Nature Reserve in St. Lucia, <a href="https://www.unilad.com/world-news" rel="noopener" target="_blank">South Africa</a>, when two hyenas entered the camp.</p><p>Hohls was at the nature reserve with his dad and some friends as part of a bachelor party.</p><p>After a long day of fishing, the group had some <a href="https://www.unilad.com/food-and-drink" rel="noopener" target="_blank">food and drinks</a> before going to <a href="https://www.unilad.com/sleep" rel="noopener" target="_blank">sleep</a> in their tents at around 1am.</p><p>But half an hour later and they had some unexpected visitors.</p><p>Two <a href="https://www.unilad.com/animals" rel="noopener" target="_blank">hyenas</a> entered Hohls' tent through a six-inch gap that he'd left unzipped.</p><p>In utter shock, Hohls woke up to find one hyena had its jaws clamped around his cheek, while the other had his ankle grasped between its teeth.</p>

<p>"One went for my leg and the other for my face and head. I fought them off by ripping my face and ankle free, then attacking the eyes of one and forcing my hand down the throat of the other," Hohls <a href="https://people.com/man-attacked-hyenas-bachelor-party-recalls-dad-finding-him-pool-blood-exclusive-11802357" rel="noopener" target="_blank">told</a> PEOPLE.</p><p>"I had been asleep... when I realized what was happening, it was pure instinct. I knew I had to fight to survive."</p><p>Hohls then went on to explain that he instantly took action with two responses - that ultimately saved his life.</p><p>"I reacted immediately. I ripped myself free and went straight for their weak points — the eyes and throat. It was all instinct and adrenaline," he said.</p>

<p>The fight lasted around 60 seconds, with Hohls adding that after hearing his screams, his dad immediately took action, driving him straight to <a href="https://www.unilad.com/health" rel="noopener" target="_blank">hospital</a>.</p><p>"My dad jumped into action immediately. He found me in a pool of blood in my tent, put me in the car, and drove me straight to Ballito hospital," he added.</p><p>"I’ve camped at Vidal before without problems. That night I left a small gap for ventilation. If the hyenas wanted to get in, they would have found a way regardless, and that’s exactly what happened."</p>

<p>Hohls had around 30 stitches in his head, hand and cheek and is suffering from deep wounds in his ankle and thigh..</p><p>"I’m doing a lot better... The doctors are happy with my progress, and there’s been no sign of infection," he explained.</p><p>"For now, it’s about rest and allowing my body to heal properly."</p><p>Meanwhile, Hohls' dad Colin, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15056883/Stag-reveller-mauled-hyenas-crashing-South-African-game-reserve-boozy-night-partying-fight-survive.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">told</a> DailyMail.com: "I heard Nic go to bed then he suddenly started screaming clearly in agony and a hyena had grabbed his left leg and was pulling him out of the tent.</p><p>"A second hyena grabbed him by his head so Nick stuck his left hand into the first hyena's mouth as deep as it would go and his right thumb in the other hyena's eye.</p><p>"Nic said they both backed off in shock and then they heard me coming and must have seen the torch and disappeared and when I got there. I never even saw them.</p><p>"It was all over in less than a minute but when I saw Nicolas he was covered in blood and I could hardly recognise him and there was a thick pool of his blood on the floor."</p><p>A spokesman for Ezemvelo KZN Wild Life who manage Cape Vidal told DailyMail.com: "We are going to catch the hyenas and work out the best way to proceed with them but in the mean time we ask all campers to make sure their tents are zipped up.</p><p>"In the incident at the weekend hyenas attacked a visitor after they had left their tent open following a party and in the previous attack a man nose was badly bitten.</p><p>"It is a wildlife park and we advise all our guests to be very mindful of that."</p><p>UNILAD has also reached out for comment.</p>

      </figure>
      <p><strong>The story of a mom who horrifically cyberbullied her daughter anonymously for around a year has come out in a new documentary, which also showed the moment police confronted her.</strong></p><p>In October 2020, 13-year-old Lauryn Licari, from<strong> </strong><a href="https://www.unilad.com/michigan" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Michigan</a>, and her then-boyfriend Owen McKenny received suspicious messages from an unknown number.</p><p>"Hi Lauryn, Owen is breaking up with you,' the first text read. "He no longer likes you and hasn't liked you for a while. It's obvious he wants me. He laughs, smiles, and touches my hair.</p><p>"We are both down to f**k. You are a sweet girl, but I know I can give him what he wants, sorry not sorry."</p><p>However, the odd <a href="https://www.unilad.com/phones" rel="noopener" target="_blank">texts</a> came to an abrupt end - only to again in September 2021, where the youngsters were on the receiving end of a barrage of insults and threats almost daily for the next 15 months.</p><p><iframe style="width: 512px; height: 288px; background-color: black;" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen src="https://www.unilad.com/jw-iframe?videoId=T3B4wVj1">﻿<span contenteditable="false"></span>﻿</iframe></p><p><a href="https://www.unilad.com/film-and-tv/netflix/netflix-doc-kendra-licari-messages-daughter-991023-20250901" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The texts eventually took a darker turn</a>, picking at the teen's appearance and personality, calling her an 'ugly a**,' 'trash b**ch' and 'anorexic flat a**.'</p><p>Other disturbing messages read: 'Kill yourself now b***h', 'jump off a bridge', 'his <a href="https://www.unilad.com/life" rel="noopener" target="_blank">life</a> would be better if you were dead', and 'finish yourself or we will #bang'.</p><p>From the content of the messages that touched on Lauryn's <a href="https://www.unilad.com/sex-and-relationships" rel="noopener" target="_blank">relationship</a> with Owen, it became clear that the person behind it could only be someone she knew personally, so their <a href="https://www.unilad.com/parenting" rel="noopener" target="_blank">parents</a> and school officials turned to law enforcement for help to find the culprit - only to make the harrowing discovery that the flurry of hate was coming from none other than Lauryn's own <a href="https://www.unilad.com/parenting" rel="noopener" target="_blank">mom</a>.</p><p>As told in a new <a href="https://www.unilad.com/Netflix" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Netflix</a> documentary, <em>Unknown Number: The High School Catfish,</em> Kendra Licari was found out when the FBI traced the IP addresses of the messages back to her.</p>

    <figcaption>Kendra Licari sent horrific messages to her daughter Lauryn and her boyfriend (Netflix)</figcaption>
  </figure>
<p>Licari had used virtual private networks (VPNs) to hide her location, according to Isabella County Prosecutor David Barberi, and tried to make it seem like the messages, which prosecutors compiled 349 pages worth, were coming from areas where other teenagers were located.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.unilad.com/police" rel="noopener" target="_blank">sheriff's</a> office had initially suspected several of the victims' classmates and friends, since the messages had used slang and abbreviations to make it look like another teen was behind the nasty content, in turn casting suspicion across the community and fracturing relationships.</p><p>Once cops raided her home, the 42-year-old confessed to her crimes while a horrified Lauryn witnessed the unmasking of her tormentor - with the encounter being caught on the officer's bodycam.</p>

<p>Kendra was charged with multiple counts of stalking and using a computer to commit a <a href="https://www.unilad.com/crime" rel="noopener" target="_blank">crime</a>. </p><p>She pleaded guilty to two counts of stalking a minor and was sentenced to 19 months to five years in prison, but was released on August 8 last year.</p><p>A court order currently prohibits her from having any contact with her daughter. However, in the documentary, the mom said she remains hopeful they <a href="https://www.unilad.com/film-and-tv/netflix/netflix-unknown-number-kendra-licari-relationship-725082-20250902" rel="noopener" target="_blank">can rebuild a relationship</a> in the future.</p><p>"Every single one of us makes mistakes, not a single one of us has lived a perfect life, and realistically, a lot of us have probably broken the law at some point or another and not gotten caught," she said in the <a href="https://www.unilad.com/documentaries" rel="noopener" target="_blank">documentary</a>. </p><p>Licari <a href="https://www.unilad.com/film-and-tv/netflix/kendra-licari-reveals-why-harassed-daughter-netflix-461771-20250901" rel="noopener" target="_blank">revealed a little bit</a> behind the reasoning for her actions; however, Barberi has an unfounded theory: that she has a kind of 'cyber' Munchausen syndrome by proxy, though he also stressed against offering up any '<a href="https://www.unilad.com/health" rel="noopener" target="_blank">medical</a>' diagnosis or basis for her crimes.</p>

      <p><strong>Donald Trump has left much of the internet shocked after suggesting 'without the United States everything in the world would die'.</strong></p><p>The POTUS appeared in front of the media in the Oval Office on Tuesday (September 2) to announce the US Space Command is to move from Colorado to Alabama.</p><p><a href="https://www.unilad.com/donald-trump" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Trump's</a> health was a big talking point in the buildup to the press conference, with some farfetched social media rumors even <a href="https://www.unilad.com/news/us-news/trump-responds-not-dead-president-373574-20250901" rel="noopener" target="_blank">suggesting the president had died</a>.</p><p>One reporter asked: "How did you find out over the weekend that you were dead? Did you see that?"</p><p>The POTUS responded: "No. Really, I didn't see that... Last week, I did numerous news conferences, they went very well like this is going very well.</p><p>"I didn't do any for two days and they said 'there must be something wrong with him'.</p><p>"Biden wouldn't do them for months, you wouldn't see him, but nobody ever said there was anything wrong with him but we know he wasn't in the greatest of shape."</p><p>A body language expert claimed Trump <a href="https://www.unilad.com/news/politics/body-language-expert-donald-trump-reaction-death-rumours-471028-20250903" rel="noopener" target="_blank">seemed uncomfortable when answering the question</a>.</p><p>Like any Trump press conferences, Tuesday's gathering was certainly full of talking points, including comments made by the president that the rest of the world would 'die' without the <a href="https://www.unilad.com/us-news" rel="noopener" target="_blank">US</a>.</p><p>Trump said: "Without the United States, the whole world would die. It's [the US] so powerful, it's so big. I made it really big in the first four years."</p><p>He claimed the country started to 'degenerate' over the Biden years, but now Trump is back in the White House he's managed to 'build it up to a level I never thought we'd be at this quick'.</p><p><iframe style="width: 512px; height: 288px; background-color: black;" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen src="https://www.unilad.com/jw-iframe?videoId=wlwR73z4">﻿<span contenteditable="false"></span>﻿</iframe></p><p>He said: "We're the hottest, we're the best, we're the best financially. The money coming in is so big because of tariffs. </p><p>"I settled seven wars and numerous of those wars were because of trade."</p><p>The comments made by Trump have shocked much of the internet, with one Reddit user simply writing: "Completely nuts."</p><p>While a second added: "Delusional."</p><p>For anyone confused about what wars Trump is referring to, he <a href="https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-interview-mark-levin-radio-show-august-19-2025/#16" rel="noopener" target="_blank">said</a> last month on Mark Levin's radio show: "I've settled six wars, and a lot of people say seven because there's one that nobody knows about."</p><p>The White House has since listed these seven conflicts as Israel and Iran, Rwanda and Democratic Republic of the Congo, Armenia and Azerbaijan, Thailand and Cambodia, India and Pakistan, Egypt and Ethiopia, and Serbia and Kosovo.</p>

  </figure>
<p>"There has been more progress towards peace than ever before because of this President's leadership," the Trump administration official wrote.</p><p>Can Trump take all the credit however?</p><p>Well, Michael O'Hanlon, a senior fellow at Brookings, feels the president does deserve some credit for the ceasefire in the Middle East.</p><p>"He managed to use a combination of a good relationship with Netanyahu, but also a willingness to put a little pressure on Netanyahu that I think contributed to the at least temporary cessation of hostilities," he <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-ended-6-or-7-wars-what-record-shows/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">told</a> CBS News.</p><p>However, Larry Haas, a senior fellow, quipped: "I very strongly disagree with the notion that the president brought peace to Iran and Israel. We may be in a quiet period in terms of direct confrontation, but Iran right now is trying to regroup."</p><p>Many of the other wars Trump says he's ended proved suspect.</p><p>Senior fellow for Southeast Asia and South Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations Josh Kurlantzick said there is 'no real ending' to the conflict between India and Pakistan.</p><p>O'Hanlon also said of the Egypt and Ethiopia tensions: "I would not call the Egypt-Ethiopia interaction a war."</p>

      <p><strong>Vladimir Putin has spoken out about Russia's alleged plans to attack Europe as World War III fears intensify.</strong></p><p>The fear of all-out war has been escalating in recent months, from tensions in the Middle East boiling over between<strong> </strong><a href="https://www.unilad.com/iran" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Iran</a> and <a href="https://www.unilad.com/israel" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Israel</a> to Russia's ongoing occupation of Ukraine and President Donald <a href="https://www.unilad.com/donald-trump" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Trump's</a> failing attempts to calm the storm.</p><p>While <a href="https://www.unilad.com/vladimir-putin" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Putin</a> and Trump came face-to-face only recently in a historic meeting, a ceasefire of any kind seems far from the realms of possibility and the <a href="https://www.unilad.com/news/politics" rel="noopener" target="_blank">POTUS</a> isn't exactly on the best of terms with Moscow's leaders, having embroiled in a war of words online with the Deputy Chairman of the Security Council of the Russian Federation, Dmitry Medvedev, which ultimately saw US forces <a href="https://www.unilad.com/news/politics/donald-trump-orders-submarines-russia-887884-20250801" rel="noopener" target="_blank">deploy nuclear submarines</a>.</p><p>Now, Putin is currently enjoying himself at a military parade in Beijing, <a href="https://www.unilad.com/china" rel="noopener" target="_blank">China</a>, following a warm welcome from XI Jinping, who referred to him as an 'old friend' - a nod of respect that probably won't extend to Trump anytime soon amid his trade war and <a href="https://www.unilad.com/tariffs" rel="noopener" target="_blank">tariff</a> plan for China.<strong><span class="ql-cursor">﻿</span></strong></p>

  </figure>
<p>Putin also praised relations with China, stating their ties are at an 'unprecedentedly high level.' As a result, European nations have since been concerned that a <a href="https://www.unilad.com/russia" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Russian</a> attack on the continent could be imminent.</p><p><a href="https://www.unilad.com/health" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Hospitals</a> across France were reportedly instructed to brace for a possible 'major military deployment' by March 2026, while <a href="https://www.unilad.com/germany" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Germany</a> said it is on alert for military drills just yesterday.</p><p>However, Putin has waved away the concerns, speaking alongside the Slovakian prime minister, Robert Fico, who claims that claims of an attack from Moscow on Europe were a 'provocation or incompetence'.</p><p>The Russian leader also said that it was 'absolute nonsense' that there were plans to strike deeper in Europe and to target NATO, slamming the response from the EU as 'hysteria' based on 'horror stories.'</p><p>"As for ‘Russia’s aggressive plans with respect to Europe’, I want to emphasise once again that this is complete nonsense, which has absolutely no basis," he said.</p>

<p>"Any sensible person realises that Russia has never had, does not have, and will not have the desire to attack anyone."</p><p>The supposed reassurance comes as the <a href="https://www.unilad.com/france" rel="noopener" target="_blank">French</a> government reportedly predicts a situation where the nation could face an influx of wounded soldiers. </p><p>However, the French Health Minister, Catherine Vautrin, said the precautions are 'perfectly normal for the country to anticipate crises and their consequences', citing the Covid-19 pandemic as an example. </p><p>Germany's Chief of Defence, Carsten Breuer, also stated that NATO and his country's forces are on alert ahead of Russia's upcoming military drills.</p><p>Although Brueuer said he doesn't anticipate Putin would attack NATO territory, as Russia has a military training base in Belarus, Germany would 'be on guard.'</p><p>Putin also addressed the matter of Ukraine possibly joining the European Union, stating he has 'never objected to this.'</p><p>However, he added: "As for NATO, this is another issue."</p>

      <p>Cardi B furiously called out a reporter after being questioned on rumours about her being pregnant.</p><p>The 'I Like It' rapper had been leaving a courtroom in <a href="https://www.unilad.com/los-angeles" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Los Angeles</a> on September 2 when she was met by journalists.</p><p>When one of the reporters asked the <a href="https://www.unilad.com/celebrity" rel="noopener" target="_blank">celebrity</a> about speculation that she was pregnant with her fourth child, as well as rumours about the <a href="https://www.unilad.com/celebrity/news/cardi-b-fans-stunned-monthly-costs-children-offset-spousal-support-506418-20250531" rel="noopener" target="_blank">child's</a> paternity, Cardi immediately challenged the question.</p><p>In a video <a href="https://www.instagram.com/backgrid_usa/reel/DOHPpUYjkK-/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">posted</a> to <a href="https://www.unilad.com/instagram" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Instagram</a>, the journalist can be heard to ask Cardi if she 'foresees any paternity issues' amid speculation that she is pregnant, having filed for divorce from her estranged husband Offset and being involved romantically with <a href="https://www.unilad.com/nfl" rel="noopener" target="_blank">NFL</a> star Stefon Diggs.</p><p>Appearing calm at first Cardi took a pen from someone nearby, apparently to sign an autograph, before seeming to throw the pen towards the reporter.</p>

<p>Calling it 'disrespectful', Cardi B accused the reporter of a sexist line of questioning in asking her about the speculation.</p><p>“Stop disrespecting me,” she said. “You’re disrespectful. Don’t do that.”</p><p>The star went on to wonder aloud why she never got questions like from female journalists.</p><p>She said: “Do you see women asking those types of questions to me?</p><p>“Why do you feel, as a man, you get to ask me those types of questions?”</p><p>Despite the journalist protesting that it was a 'legit question', the rapper was not fazed.</p><p>In a parting shot before getting into an SUV that was waiting for her, the rapper told the reporter: "Act like you have some manners and your mama taught you - respect women.”</p>

      <p><strong>The daughter of a mom who anonymously bullied and harassed her child for over a year explains why she still loves her.</strong></p><p>Lauryn Licari, 13, and her boyfriend at the time, Owen McKenny, began receiving numerous anonymous messages in October 2020.</p><p>After stopping for a bit, the threatening texts resumed almost a year later in September 2021.</p><p>They included cruel comments about the teens' relationship, Lauryn's appearance and even death threats.</p><p>Lauryn's mother, <a href="https://www.unilad.com/film-and-tv/netflix/kendra-licari-reveals-why-harassed-daughter-netflix-461771-20250901" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Kendra Licari</a>, and Owen's mother collaborated with school officials and law enforcement in Beal City in an attempt to catch the anonymous stalker. But it was soon discovered it was Kendra <a href="https://www.unilad.com/community/teen-anonymous-internet-bully-mom-225661-20221217" rel="noopener" target="_blank">all along</a>.</p><p>The case is explored in the new <a href="https://www.unilad.com/netflix" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Netflix</a> documentary, <a href="https://www.unilad.com/film-and-tv/netflix/netflix-doc-kendra-licari-messages-daughter-991023-20250901" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Unknown Number: The High School Catfish</em></a>.</p><p>The doc charts what happened when Lauryn and Owen first started receiving the messages, as well as the investigation and eventually, what happened when Kendra was exposed.</p>

  </figure>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.unilad.com/documentaries" rel="noopener" target="_blank">documentary</a>, Kendra insisted that she didn't send the initial messages received by her daughter, which told her Owen was going to break up with her, and that she only sent those that followed in an attempt to get to the bottom of things.</p><p>She said: "The messages stopped for a little bit, and then they picked back up. In my mind, I'm like, 'How long do we let this go on? What do I do as a <a href="https://www.unilad.com/parenting" rel="noopener" target="_blank">parent</a>?'</p><p>"I really wanted to get to the bottom of who it was. And that's when I started sending the text messages to Lauryn and Owen."</p><p>Kendra claimed that she hoped the teens would discuss the messages with their friends and 'something might come up that could help pinpoint where they were originating from'.</p><p>"I started in the thoughts of needing some answers, and then I just kept going, it was a spiral, kind of a snowball effect, I don't think I knew how to stop," she admitted.</p><p>"I was somebody different in those moments. I was in an awful place mentally. It was like I had a mask on or something, I didn't even know who I was."</p><p>She also added: "As [Lauryn] started getting older, I had things that were suppressed come forward. A lot of it was previous trauma starting to resurface that I didn't know how to handle. When I was 17, I was raped, and as my daughter was hitting those teenage years, I got scared.</p><p>"I wanted to try to control the outcome of her journey. I was afraid of letting her grow up. I was scared of what could happen to her."</p>

<p>During the doc, Lauryn - who lives with her dad Shawn Licari - also spoke about how she feels, years on from the incident</p><p>"Being without that relationship is really hurting me. I think rebuilding our relationship will help both of us a lot. I love her more than anything," she said.</p><p>She added that she wants to see her mom 'when the time is right' and hopes she is getting the help she needs.</p>

<h2>Where is Kendra Licari now?</h2><p>Kendra has previously expressed remorse for her actions, and in the documentary, she says she is very 'disappointed' in herself and that she has let herself and her family down.</p><p>She was charged with two counts of stalking a minor and two counts of communicating with another to commit a crime.</p><p>She was sentenced to serve 19 months to five years in prison for her crimes.</p><p>Kendra was released on parole in August last year and remains under supervision.</p><p>Explaining she is not currently allowed to see Lauryn, she said: "It's been about a year and a half since I've seen her.</p><p>"We both know that we're with each other no matter what. I definitely think we can have a healthy relationship. I know we both hold that bond that we have close."</p><p>Shawn and Kendra are now divorced, with Shawn explaining: "I just can't believe she would do something like that to her daughter that supposedly she loved dearly.</p><p>"Just makes me sick. She stabbed me in the heart — shot me in the heart — and threw it away."</p>

<p>"I was so scared in that moment," Megan added.</p><p>The mom-of-two contacted her dad, who spoke to Maureen and said her mom had promised she would come home.</p><p>However, the following day Megan learned Maureen had pressed ahead with her plans - in a notification that she would receive her ashes.</p><p>"What was worse was not only did I get the text on <a href="https://www.unilad.com/whatsapp" rel="noopener" target="_blank">WhatsApp</a>, they had advised me that her ashes would be posted to me in 6-8 weeks,” she said. “In that very moment, because I was alone, I just sat there with the baby and cried… I just felt like my world ended.”</p><p>The message came from Pegasos, an assisted dying nonprofit company in Liestal, Switzerland, and discovered her mom had secretly filled out an application and paid £15,000 (around $20,000) for the process.</p><p><a href="https://www.dignityindying.org.uk/assisted-dying/assisted-dying-around-the-world/europe/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">According</a> to Dignity in Dying, Switzerland is one of nine countries in Europe that legally permits people the right to access assisted suicide, though some countries such as Austria and Portugal have stricter conditions such as a terminal illness or chronic conditions to apply.</p><p>The practice has been permitted in Switzerland since 1942 and unlike some other EU countries, is open to anyone including non-Swiss residents.</p>

<p>However, euthanasia is illegal, meaning the patient has to administer the <a href="https://www.unilad.com/drugs" rel="noopener" target="_blank">drugs</a> themselves rather than a doctor.</p><p>As for Maureen, her family say she did suffer with her <a href="https://www.unilad.com/mental-health" rel="noopener" target="_blank">mental health</a> and had even attempted to take her life in the past while grieving the deaths of her two younger sisters but still had 'a lot more life to give.'</p><p>“No one’s saying she wasn’t feeling pain,” Megan told the outlet. “She was just in a dark time. She wasn’t terminally ill or, in my opinion, ill enough to go and do this and leave our family behind like that.</p><p>"They [Pegasos] should not have allowed her to make that decision on her own," she <a href="https://righttolife.org.uk/news/clinic-tells-family-of-mothers-assisted-suicide-via-whatsapp-and-says-ashes-in-the-post" rel="noopener" target="_blank">added</a> to Right to Life.

<p>The family are now quizzing the company's verification process after Pegasos claimed Maureen had been suffering with 'unbearable chronic pain' and that it had received a letter and an email from Megan that supposedly outlined her awareness of her mom's plans.</p><p>But Megan believes her mom had forged the letter and responded to the email on her behalf.</p><p>“It wasn’t even my email.

      <p><strong>A body language expert has spoken about President Donald Trump's reaction to a reporter asking him about the rumours he had died.</strong></p><p>On Tuesday (September 2), <a href="https://www.unilad.com/politics" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The White House</a> revealed that <a href="https://www.unilad.com/donald-trump" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Trump</a> would be making an announcement later that day.</p><p>And considering the internet had been rife with speculation about his <a href="https://www.unilad.com/health" rel="noopener" target="_blank">health</a> - with some social media comments even spreading rumors that he had died - people were keen to hear what the press conference would be about.</p><p>While it turned out to focus on the <a href="https://www.unilad.com/us-news" rel="noopener" target="_blank">US</a> Space Command HQ's move to Alabama, that didn't stop reporters from asking questions about some of the rumors that had been circulating.</p><p>One said: "How did you find out over the weekend that you were dead? Did you see that?"</p><p><iframe style="width: 512px; height: 288px; background-color: black;" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen src="https://www.unilad.com/jw-iframe?videoId=Ov1VWjyn">﻿<span contenteditable="false"></span>﻿</iframe></p><p>Trump responded: "No. Really, I didn't see that... Last week, I did numerous news conferences, they went very well like this is going very well.</p><p>"I didn't do any for two days and they said 'there must be something wrong with him'.</p><p>"Biden wouldn't do them for months, you wouldn't see him, but nobody ever said there was anything wrong with him but we know he wasn't in the greatest of shape."</p><p>After explaining the numerous things he had been up to over the weekend, Trump added: "I was very active over the weekend, I didn't hear that one, that's pretty serious.</p><p>"It's fake news. I knew they were saying 'is he okay?'... it's also a longer weekend, Labor Day weekend, I was very active."</p><p>Following the comments, body language expert <a href="https://drbethdawson.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dr Beth Dawson</a> explained that Trump displayed subtle signs of discomfort while answering the question.</p><p>She told UNILAD: "While Trump listens to the journalist’s question, his baseline communication is very typical of him: he sits still, head slightly tilted, lips pressed together. But as soon as he is asked, 'How did it feel to hear people thought you were dead?' we catch some body leakage: a subtle sideways eye shift. Paired with tension in the face; tight lips, a slight frown, this kind of eye movement often signals suspicion, evaluation and self-protection, as though he is literally 'looking sideways' at the question without wanting to confront it head-on.</p>

  </figure>
<p>"He is thinking about how to answer, but he is not fully at ease: he doesn’t laugh, smile, or shake his head. His body stays very still, and there is a pause that lasts slightly longer after the word 'demise'. He is definitely not comfortable with this line of questioning."</p><p>Dawson also explained that viewers can witness a 'lip lick' from Trump, often seen in high-pressure moments.</p><p>"The mouth often dries because stress activates the body’s fight-or-flight response," she continued.</p><p>"Licking the lips is a self-soothing behaviour, an unconscious effort to stay in control. It can also signal nervous anticipation, bracing for a difficult moment. When combined with the shrug and eye shift, it speaks less of composure and more of discomfort.</p><p>"There are also flashes of sadness and anxiety. The corners of the mouth pull down; a recognised part of the sadness expression, and when paired with a curling lip, it reveals tension.</p><p>"For a split second, his face betrays a lack of full confidence before he reasserts control."</p>

  </figure>
<p>When Trump discussed Biden, Dawson explained he is using a deflection tactic.</p><p>"By shifting the topic to Biden, Trump diverts the spotlight away from himself," she said.</p><p>"It’s a familiar rhetorical tactic: draw a comparison, or buy time. He could reassure the audience by addressing his health directly, which is what they expect, but by deflecting to Biden, he takes the heat off himself.</p><p>"When he talks about 'fake news', Trump adjusts his posture, standing taller. Symbolically, this says: 'I’m emphasising this point.' But because the phrase 'fake news' carries weight in his communication, the shift also betrays defensiveness, showing just how much the question about his demise touched a nerve.</p><p>"Later, when he says, 'I was very active this Labour Day,' his eyebrows shoot up. This isn’t accidental. Raised brows act like a non-verbal exclamation mark. They sell the point, add emphasis, and invite acknowledgement from the audience. A classic self-promotion cue."</p><p>UNILAD has reached out to The White House for comment.</p>

      <p><strong>A common sex dream that may leave you riddled with anxiety does not mean that you have a subconscious desire to cheat on your partner, an expert has said.</strong></p><p>We've all been there, the perfect domestic bliss of a loving relationship hurled into internal panic after a celebrity crush like<a href="https://www.unilad.com/celebrity/news/taylor-swift-travis-kelce-podcast-album-fan-realization-093778-20250812" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> Travis Kelce or Taylor Swift</a>, or perhaps both, appears in a NSFW dream.</p><p>Of course, the worst part of it all is that despite <a href="https://www.unilad.com/sleep" rel="noopener" target="_blank">sleeping</a> in the arms of a gorgeous partner, you wake up conflicted about just how much you enjoyed that extremely rude dream.</p><p>Wracked with guilt at your somnial sin, you become convinced you're a terrible partner, that it's only a matter of time before you succumb to temptation and send your <a href="https://www.unilad.com/sex-and-relationships" rel="noopener" target="_blank">relationship</a> hurtling into the abyss with your <a href="https://www.unilad.com/news/sex-and-relationships/why-people-cheat-relationships-affair-896462-20250712" rel="noopener" target="_blank">infidelity</a>.</p>

    <figcaption>Let's face it, we've all had those dreams (Getty stock images)</figcaption>
  </figure>
<p>But fear not, because expert Lauri Loewenberg has said that far from meaning that you want to 'play away', cheating dreams actually <a href="https://www.unilad.com/news/sex-and-relationships/expert-issues-warning-common-sex-dream-698447-20250902" rel="noopener" target="_blank">express a different anxiety about a relationship</a>.</p><p>Ms Loewenberg, a certified dream analyst and member of the International Association for the Study of Dreams (IASD), explained that this may actually be a manifestation of other worries about your relationship.</p><p>She <a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/relationships/a22738831/dreams-about-cheating/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">told</a> Women's Health: “In my research and experience helping my clients understand their cheating dreams, I have found the main reason you cheat in your dreams is because - deep down - you have guilt or concern about something you’re doing that is taking away from the time you should be putting into the relationship."</p><p>That's all very well, but what are these guilts or concerns that might be making you have dreams about doing the horizontal tango with someone else?</p><p>One is that you may feel guilty about another thing that you've done in your waking life, which could be anything that is pulling you away from your relationship such as work or the upheaval of becoming a parent.</p><p>A less innocent reason could be that even though you've remained faithful in this relationship, you've cheated on a partner in the past.</p>

  </figure>
<p>“Infidelity can be traumatic and very difficult to heal from," said Loewenberg. "Even if it has been years or decades since the transgression, the emotional scar often remains. This includes the scar of guilt with the transgressor.”</p><p>Finally, it could be that the dream is happening because the relationship perhaps isn't perfect.</p><p>Loewenberg explained: “Cheating dreams are rarely about sex but are, more often, a brutally honest reflection of the dynamics within the relationship."</p><p>So, while it may not be a sign that you want to cheat, it could mean that there is something in the relationship that needs work.</p>

      <p><strong>Elon Musk's daughter has shared a very honest message after she cut ties with her billionaire dad, who claimed she was dead. </strong></p><p>Vivian Wilson famously fell out with her father, after she transitioned to become a female.</p><p>Prior to their estrangement, Wilson had attended a school located in Bel-Air before moving to Ad Astra, a school Musk created for <a href="https://www.unilad.com/space-x" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SpaceX </a>employees because he did not agree with how her previous school was being ran and taught.</p><p>At Ad Astra, there were no grades and mostly STEM classes. Wilson then transferred to Crossroads in Santa Monica, where she ultimately graduated from a class of 'nepo babies'.</p><p>In a new <a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/vivian-wilson-elon-musk-daughter-2025-fall-fashion-issue-cover-story.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">interview</a> with The Cut, Wilson explained: "I was not popular, I didn't talk to anyone."</p><p>Wilson came out as transgender at 16. After she turned 18 in 2022, her relationship with Musk spiralled even more.</p>

  </figure>
<p>Wilson submitted a petition to change her name and gender, in which she made it clear how she felt about Musk. </p><p>She wrote to the judge: "I no longer live or wish to be related to my biological father in any way, shape or form."</p><p>While campaigning on behalf of <a href="https://www.unilad.com/donald-trump" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Donald Trump</a> and other MAGA republicans, <a href="https://www.unilad.com/elon-musk" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Musk</a> said that Wilson had been killed by the 'woke mind virus'. Wilson was quick to snap back on<a href="https://www.unilad.com/social-media" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> social media</a>, to remind him that she was not dead.</p><p>Now, she's shared insights of her living situation in Los Angeles, without any financial help from her billionaire father.</p><p>She shared a candid message, explaining: "College is expensive, <a href="https://www.unilad.com/celebrity/elon-musk-daughter-vivian-how-much-money-inheritance-trust-fund-586050-20250530" rel="noopener" target="_blank">I don't have that inheritance.</a> People assume I have a lot of <a href="https://www.unilad.com/money" rel="noopener" target="_blank">money</a>. I don't have hundreds and thousands of dollars at my disposal."</p><p>Wilson is the oldest of Musk's 14 other children, but unlike her father, Vivian does not have any desire to be 'super rich'. Instead, she happily lives with three other roommates because it is 'cheaper'.</p>

<p>She appreciates she is better off than a lot of other people of her age in Los Angeles. </p><p>She told The Cut: "I don't have any desire to be super rich. I can afford food. I have friends, a shelter and expandable income, which is nice and much more fortunate than most people my age in Los Angeles."</p><p>That being said, Wilson still continues to have worries about money and tries her best to save.</p><p>She said: "My mom is rich right? But obviously the other one (Musk) is unimaginable degrees of wealthy."</p><p>Musk has an estimated net worth of $413 billion.</p><p>Now focusing on her future, Wilson is hoping in the upcoming months to enrol at a community college to keep studying other languages, after she dropped out of her Japanese studies in Japan.</p>

<p>However, one GP has revealed there are five common errors people make when stopping treatment. </p><p>While many worry about food noise returning and piling the pounds back on, there are ways to prepare.</p><p>Dr Donald Grant, GP and Senior Clinical Advisor at <a href="https://www.theindependentpharmacy.co.uk/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Independent Pharmacy</a>, has set out the five mistakes people make, adding: "Weight loss injections are still incredibly popular, but like any treatment, there’s a correct way to stop.</p><p>"From not amending diets to going cold turkey, there’s a range of common errors that could lead to weight gain."</p><h2><strong>The five mistakes people quitting weight loss injections make</strong></h2><h3><strong>Quitting cold turkey</strong></h3><p>Dr Grant warns that the sudden return of appetite after quitting weight-loss jabs can lead to poor <a href="https://www.unilad.com/food-and-drink" rel="noopener" target="_blank">eating</a> habits and potential weight gain.</p><p>"To avoid this, people should communicate directly with their GP before ending any treatment plans. A medical professional can advise further on a potential tapering plan, while also providing dietary advice and lifestyle habits that can help reduce weight gain, once the treatment has finished," he added.</p><h3><strong>Skipping the lifestyle shift</strong></h3>

  </figure>
<p>If you've not already built up a regular exercise regime while on weight loss jabs, Dr Grant recommends doing so.</p><p>"It’s common for people to neglect lifestyle changes, quickly leading to weight gain and stunting all progress obtained from the treatment," the medic said.</p><p>"I recommend aiming for around 30 minutes of exercise each day. This could be a walk, jog, cycle or a short trip to the gym."</p><h3><strong>Ignoring the diet factor</strong></h3><p>Avoiding any changes to diets is a sure-fire way to regain weight lost throughout the treatment, Dr Grant warns.</p><p>He continued: "As appetite differs dramatically, once coming off the injections, it’s important for people to draw up a dietary plan, including structured meal times to avoid overeating.</p><p>"I also recommend a well-balanced diet including a variety of high-protein, fibre-rich and healthy fat foods. Instead of opting for crash diets, people should establish a well-structured diet that ensures they get all the essential nutrients to support well-being."</p><h3><strong>Pulling the plug too soon</strong></h3>

  </figure>
<p>Stopping weight loss treatment too early is one of the most common errors people make.</p><p>"These drugs are designed to be used long-term - not doing so gives the body little time to adapt to the treatment. By adopting the treatment long-term, people can obtain all the benefits while reducing the risk of regaining weight once they come off these injections," Dr Grant added.</p><p>Of course, if you're experiencing uncomfortable side effects, you should contact your GP right away.</p><h3><strong>Avoiding the scales</strong></h3><p>Dr Grant notes it's important to not create an unhealthy relationship when it comes to weight management.</p><p>However, tracking weight once treatment ends can help people adjust their routine to avoid losing progress.</p><p>He said: "Weight loss injections can be expensive, especially when utilised long-term. By monitoring weight closely, people can avoid losing value from the treatments while maintaining a healthier physique."</p><p>Dr Grant concluded: "Overall, these common mistakes act as a warning to anyone currently thinking about ending their weight loss treatment. While these injections are incredibly effective, not amending lifestyle habits or diet can have massive impacts on progress, often leading to regained weight."</p>

      <p><strong>A Jeffrey Epstein survivor has spoken about how an excerpt from her high school yearbook reveals the emotional turmoil she was going through at the time.</strong></p><p>Ashley Rubright was introduced to <a href="https://www.unilad.com/jeffrey-epstein" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Epstein</a> when she was aged 15.</p><p>She decided to speak out for the first time after explaining that fellow survivors - who she calls her 'soul sisters' - are speaking to Congress this week.</p><p>GOP Rep Thomas Massie and Democrat Ro Khanna are collecting signatures for a bill that would require the <a href="https://www.unilad.com/news/politics/donald-trump-epstein-files-controversy-543138-20250728" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Trump team to hand over all Epstein material</a>.</p><p>They are set to hold a press conference with Epstein survivors, many of whom have never spoken out publicly.</p><p>“This press conference is going to be explosive. It’s the first time that a lot of these victims are speaking out publicly,” Khanna told CNN.</p><p>Speaking for the first time publicly <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/09/02/us/jeffrey-epstein-survivors-interview" rel="noopener" target="_blank">to</a> CNN this week, Rubright explained there was a clear difference in her high school yearbook the year before she met Epstein, compared to the year after.</p>

<p>“Everybody that signed my yearbooks... was like ‘Have a great summer!’ ‘Let’s chill,’ ‘It was great hanging out with you this year,’” Rubright said, explaining that all the comments in the book prior to meeting Epstein were 'all positive'.</p><p>But after meeting the <a href="https://www.unilad.com/crime" rel="noopener" target="_blank">convicted</a> paedophile, Rubright explained there was a noticeable difference in the comments her friends made at the end of the school year.</p><p>Rubright recalled: “The next yearbook that came out... all the comments were different: ‘I’m really worried about you,’ ‘Don’t do anything stupid this summer.’”</p><p>Rubright said she only realised the impact it had on her after she moved out of her parents' home at the age of 17.</p><p>“I was like, ‘Wow, that really did impact me back then'," she added.</p>

<p>While a number of documents from the Department of Justice were recently released, Democrats argue they contain little new information.</p><p>The US House Oversight Committee released 33,295 pages of the heavily classified documents, including flight logs, jail surveillance video, court filings, audio recordings, and emails.</p><p>But it fell short at revealing the disgraced financier's alleged 'client list' - which <a href="https://unilad.com/conspiracy-theories" rel="noopener" target="_blank">conspiracy theorists</a> believe the socialite kept a diary of people involved in his sex trafficking. The FBI has insisted no client list exists.</p>

<p>Oversight Committee Chair Republican James Comer has said the Department of Justice has informed him of its plans to continue to release additional records.</p><p>"This is the most thorough investigation into Epstein and Maxwell to date, and we are getting results," he said. "We have already deposed former Attorney General Bill Barr, the Department of Justice provided nearly 34,000 pages of documents, and will produce more, which are being made public as we speak."</p>

      <p>A body language expert has analyzed the interactions between Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping at a recent summit in Beijing.</p><p>The meeting between the <a href="https://www.unilad.com/russia" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Russian</a> and <a href="https://www.unilad.com/china" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Chinese</a> presidents, along with North Korea's <a href="https://www.unilad.com/kim-jong-un" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Kim Jong Un</a>, came at an event marking 80 years since the end of World War Two.</p><p>A military parade marched through the Chinese capital in honor of the anniversary on Wednesday (September 3), with leaders from some 26 countries friendly to Beijing in attendance.</p><p>A crucial moment ahead of the proceedings came as <a href="https://www.unilad.com/vladimir-putin" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Vladimir Putin</a> and Xi Jinping shook hands in front of the cameras before the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit.</p><p>As Beijing is steeped in geopolitical intrigue during the proceedings, body language expert Beth Dawson has provided her assessment of what the leaders' public body language might reveal about their feelings towards one another.</p>

<p>In an interview with the New York Post, Dawson <a href="https://nypost.com/video/body-language-expert-on-xi-putin-and-modis-carefully-cast-stage-play/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">described</a> the main meaning behind the leaders' body language as 'unity', but noted a shift in Putin's tone later on.</p><p>"We're seeing some genuine gestures of warmth," she said.</p><p>Nonetheless, the expert called the occasion a '<a href="https://www.unilad.com/politics" rel="noopener" target="_blank">political</a> performance', saying: "They want to convey a message that signals unity."</p><p>Dawson began by comparing the walks of the Russian and Chinese presidents, highlighting that Putin appeared 'in control' and was walking much quicker than Jinping, who she described as having a much more 'measured and deliberate gait'.</p><p><br></p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true" align="center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Moment Putin and Xi shook hands in Tianjin. <a href="https://t.co/FitxkU5dva">pic.twitter.com/FitxkU5dva</a></p>— Margarita Simonyan (@M_Simonyan) <a href="https://twitter.com/M_Simonyan/status/1962118971227812045?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 31, 2025</a></blockquote>

<p>She added: "When he meets Putin what we do see though is a very interesting handshake.</p><p>"First of all both men look directly at each other, both men smile at each other, with Putin we can actually see the smile reaching the eyes, that's how we know whether a smile is genuine or not because we see the crinkles in the eyes."</p>

  </figure>
<p>A big moment then comes as Jinping can be seen 'placing his hand on top of Putin's', which Dawson called the 'hand sandwich' and explained: "This move can actually signal dominance, but here because of the smiles, because of the prolonged eye contact and also because of the proximity both men step towards each other."</p><p>She claimed that means that the two leaders are 'feeling comfortable with each other' or 'they are at least trying to'.</p><p>After greeting Xi Jinping's wife, Peng Liyuan, and stepping back to face the press, Dawson noted that Putin's expression 'shifts slightly'.</p><p>"His mouth closes, his face looks more serious," she said, but added that there was still a hint of an eye crinkle.</p><p>Dawson noted: "Putin is very pleased to be there."</p><p>The proceedings were also clocked by US President <a href="https://www.unilad.com/Donald-Trump" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Donald Trump</a>, who wrote on Truth Social: "Please give my warmest regards to Vladimir Putin, and Kim Jong Un, as you conspire against The United States of America."</p>

      <p><strong>A supposedly crucial piece of footage missing from the night Jeffrey Epstein died has been released as Donald Trump unveiled more than 33,000 pages of documents on the disgraced financier. </strong></p><p>The <a href="https://www.unilad.com/us-news" rel="noopener" target="_blank">US</a> president has faced mounting backlash in recent months for going back on his pre-election promise of unveiling said documents.</p><p>Between batting away <a href="https://www.unilad.com/news/us-news/trump-responds-not-dead-president-373574-20250901" rel="noopener" target="_blank">rumors of his own death</a> and worrying that China, North Korea and Russia are conspiring against America, he ordered the release of 33,295 pages of the elusive files on Tuesday (September 2).</p><p>Multi-millionaire <a href="https://www.unilad.com/jeffrey-epstein" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Epstein</a> had mingled with some of the most powerful people in the <a href="https://www.unilad.com/world-news" rel="noopener" target="_blank">world</a> - but he was eventually exposed for <a href="https://www.unilad.com/sex-trafficking" rel="noopener" target="_blank">sex trafficking</a> underage girls.</p><p>He dodged jail time back in 2008 with a controversial plea deal, only to be arrested again in July 2019 on fresh federal charges.</p><p>Just days later, he was found dead while on 'suicide watch' in his Manhattan jail cell. His death was later ruled a suicide by officials.</p>

<p>Footage from outside the 66-year-old's jail cell the night he died was released two months ago, though not in full. Most notably, a 'missing minute' between 11.59pm on August 9 and midnight on August 10 2019 was spotted, fueling conspiracy theories and rumors. Epstein was ruled to have died on August 10.</p><p>Among the new releases ordered by <a href="https://www.unilad.com/donald-trump" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Trump</a> was court filings, emails, flight logs - and some fresh jail surveillance video footage.</p><p>Two extra hours of video - totaling 13 hours and 41 seconds - covering August 9 and 10 were released.</p><p>Now, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cp949lrj373o" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the</a> BBC reports, the 'missing minute' has been filled, and while theorists hoped it would shed new light on the truth behind Epstein's death - it hasn't. Nothing new actually happens in this newly-released footage.</p><p>The original prison CCTV from the July release is still missing, but footage from a slightly different angle does show the minute between 11.59pm and 12am - with nothing unusual happening during it.</p><p>This may cause confusion given Pam Bondi's original explanation of the minute's absence.</p>

<p>She claimed the missing minute was a result of the video being 'reset', and that 'every night should have the same minute missing'. Yet this CCTV reset doesn't seem to be evident in this new clip.</p><p>Missing from the many pages of Epstein files is his rumored secret 'client list' which people reckon could implicate other powerful individuals in his illegal activities.</p><p>Back in July, Trump publicly dismissed the Epstein Files as fabrications engineered by the Democrats and urged supporters to drop the matter entirely.</p><p>Later that month, he rejected the existence of a client list, calling it a 'hoax' and criticizing ongoing investigations as politically motivated.</p><p>Yet a Financial Times analysis <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/4aed7e1d-db7a-42b9-b548-1db3a1f0b08a?" rel="noopener" target="_blank">reports</a> that Trump made a 'campaign promise to release the so-called Epstein files', a pledge his supporters still cited in July 2025 when the administration declined to publish any additional documents.</p>

<p>While Trump and Epstein were formerly friends, the pair's relationship soured after the financier began poaching his staff, according to Trump.</p><p>"He took people that work for me, and I told him, 'Don’t do it any more'. And he did it. I said, 'Stay the hell out of here'," the POTUS told reporters.</p>

      <p><strong>Donald Trump cannot use an 18th-century law to deport people accused of being part of a 'Venezuelan gang' in several southern states, a US appeals court has ruled.</strong></p><p>In his commitment to crack down on immigration,<strong> </strong><a href="https://www.unilad.com/donald-trump" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Trump </a>has been pulling all the stops in a controversial attempt to fuel mass deportations of migrants, and this includes attempting to reinstate a few older laws.</p><p><a href="https://www.unilad.com/news/politics/donald-trump-law-insurrection-act-1807-explained-124474-20250611" rel="noopener" target="_blank">One such law</a> would allow the use of active-duty <a href="https://www.unilad.com/military" rel="noopener" target="_blank">military</a> personnel to carry out law enforcement across the country, while another, from 1798, has only been used three times in <a href="https://www.unilad.com/us-news" rel="noopener" target="_blank">US</a> history.</p><p>However, it seems as though the latter has been stopped in its tracks.</p><p>The decision, announced on Tuesday night (September 2), came from the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals, a conservative panel of three federal judges, and could serve as a stepping stone to a ruling from the US Supreme Court on the matter.</p>

<p>In a 2-1 ruling in agreement with lawyers advocating for immigrants' rights, as well as lower circuit US judges, the 5th Circuit panel decided that the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 (AEA) should not be used against the Venezuelan <a href="https://www.unilad.com/crime" rel="noopener" target="_blank">criminal</a> organization Tren de Aragua.</p><p>Judges Leslie Southwick and Irma Carrillo Ramirez wrote that a 'predatory incursion' by the Venezuelan gang had not occurred, a crucial component of the Act.</p><p>"We conclude that the findings do not support that an invasion or a predatory incursion has occurred," Judge Southwick wrote (<a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/09/02/politics/appeals-court-ruling-trump-alien-enemies-act-deportations-unlawful" rel="noopener" target="_blank">via</a> CNN). "We therefore conclude that petitioners are likely to prove that the AEA was improperly invoked."</p><p>Lee Gelernt, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) who represents Venezuelan people being detained in North Texas in their challenge against deportation under the Alien Enemies Act, said: “The Trump administration’s use of a wartime statute during peacetime to regulate immigration was rightly shut down by the court.</p><p>"This is a critically important decision reining in the administration’s view that it can simply declare an emergency without any oversight by the courts.”</p><h2>What is the Alien Enemies Act and how is Trump planning to use it?</h2>

  </figure>
<p>The 1798 law was originally used as a wartime authority for deportations from Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi, and Trump's reliance on it back in March this year sparked the first in a series of legal challenges.</p><p><a href="https://www.unilad.com/news/politics/trump-deportations-world-war-two-camps-868334-20250204" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Under the law</a>, the Act can be invoked during a 'declared war' or 'any invasion or predatory incursion' by a foreign government against the US government. It can remain in effect until the president terminates it.</p><p>Before Trump's use of it, the Act had only been used during the War of 1812 and in World War I and World War II, when it was infamously used to intern citizens of Italian, German, and Japanese nationality in camps.</p><p>Trump has previously declared his intent to use the law to fast-track deportations from the US and to 'dismantle every migrant criminal network operating on American soil'.</p><h2>Why the court has blocked Trump's plan</h2>

      <p><strong>Drake has admitted his six-pack doesn't actually look like his viral selfie would have us believe.</strong></p><p>The rapper took to Instagram back in June to reveal his impeccable abs but all it really did was spark fresh rumors that he had been on the operating table to have them sculpted for him.</p><p>He captioned the post: "I’m wide awake for the nights that separate the type who get to it til they get it right from the type who just …type."</p><p>Now, three months later, the 'Take Care' hitmaker has revealed the truth over whether accusations that he photoshopped the picture are true.</p><p>While appearing as a guest on the <em>Not This Again with Bobbi Althoff</em> <a href="https://www.unilad.com/podcast" rel="noopener" target="_blank">podcast</a>, the 38-year-old claimed his son has an 'eight-pack' - having previously posted a picture on his <a href="https://www.unilad.com/Instagram" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Instagram</a> Story of seven-year-old Adonis Graham with his top up with the word 'shredder' on it.</p>

      <p><strong>A dad who discovered his wife had been anonymously bullying and harassing their daughter has spoken about the moment he found out.</strong></p><p>13-year-old Lauryn Licari began receiving numerous anonymous messages in October 2020, and her then-boyfriend, Owen McKenny, was also receiving them.</p><p>After stopping for a bit, the threatening texts resumed almost a year later in September 2021.</p><p>Lauryn's mother, <a href="https://www.unilad.com/film-and-tv/netflix/kendra-licari-reveals-why-harassed-daughter-netflix-461771-20250901" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Kendra Licari</a>, and Owen's mother collaborated with school officials and law enforcement in Beal City in an attempt to catch the anonymous stalker. But it was soon discovered it was Kendra <a href="https://www.unilad.com/community/teen-anonymous-internet-bully-mom-225661-20221217" rel="noopener" target="_blank">all along</a>.</p><p>The case is explored in the new <a href="https://www.unilad.com/netflix" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Netflix</a> documentary, <a href="https://www.unilad.com/film-and-tv/netflix/netflix-doc-kendra-licari-messages-daughter-991023-20250901" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Unknown Number: The High School Catfish</em></a>.</p><p>The doc delves into how police uncovered the truth, and the <a href="https://www.unilad.com/technology" rel="noopener" target="_blank">messages</a> that Lauryn and Owen received, including 'He thinks you're ugly', referring to Owen, as well as 'You're worthless', 'We won' and 'He thinks you're trash'.</p>

<p>Disturbingly, some messages even included sexually explicit terms, saying that they wanted to 'bang' Owen and telling Lauryn that Owen didn't want her and that they are 'both down to f***'.</p><p>The doc also reveals the moment that Lauryn's dad, Shawn Licari, discovered the truth.</p><p>He said: "I get this crazy phone call at work, and it's the sheriff saying that they figured it out. I'm like, 'sweet, finally this is gonna be over with'.</p><p>"He's like, 'I'm sorry, I gotta' tell you this... unfortunately it's your wife'."</p><p>Shawn explained he was speechless at the news, and rushed home from work where he was met by the sheriff on the front porch.</p><p>In body cam footage of the moment, he told Shawn: "This is the deal, every time the kids received a message, her number came back.</p><p>"So that was enough for a search warrant, and that's why we're here today.</p><p>"So we took her phone and her computer, my detective is collecting that."</p><p><iframe style="width: 512px; height: 288px; background-color: black;" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen src="https://www.unilad.com/jw-iframe?videoId=T3B4wVj1">﻿<span contenteditable="false"></span>﻿</iframe></p><p>Shawn asked the sheriff which phone the authorities took, explaining that Kendra had more than one.</p><p>"I have a search warrant for all of them, so I'd like to get all of them," he said.</p><p>"Felony stalking. That's what the charge is.</p><p>"I knew there was a lot of things going on... I know she was let go from Ferris."</p><p>Shawn explained how the police told him that Kendra had lost both of her jobs, but he was under the impression that she had resigned.</p>

<p>Speaking in the doc, the sheriff said: "Shawn looked like a broken person, he just... he was trying to process what I had just told him.</p><p>"There was a lot more to unpack than just what was going on with Lauryn."</p><p>Shawn then entered the property where Kendra and Lauryn were sitting.</p><p>He questioned Kendra regarding the two jobs she lost, before ringing Kendra's parents to come and collect her.</p><p>"We've got to be separated for a little while," said Shawn, who was visibly in shock at what he had heard.</p><p>In the <a href="https://www.unilad.com/documentaries" rel="noopener" target="_blank">documentary</a>, Kendra insisted that she didn't send the initial messages received by her daughter, which told her Owen was going to break up with her, and that she only sent those that followed in an attempt to get to the bottom of things.</p><p>She said: "The messages stopped for a little bit, and then they picked back up. In my mind, I'm like, 'How long do we let this go on? What do I do as a <a href="https://www.unilad.com/parenting" rel="noopener" target="_blank">parent</a>?'</p><p>"I really wanted to get to the bottom of who it was. And that's when I started sending the text messages to Lauryn and Owen."</p>

<p>Kendra claimed that she hoped the teens would discuss the messages with their friends and 'something might come up that could help pinpoint where they were originating from'.</p><p>"I started in the thoughts of needing some answers, and then I just kept going, it was a spiral, kind of a snowball effect, I don't think I knew how to stop," she admitted. "I was somebody different in those moments. I was in an awful place mentally. It was like I had a mask on or something, I didn't even know who I was."</p><p>Kendra has previously expressed remorse for her actions, and in the documentary, she says she is very 'disappointed' in herself and that she has let herself and her family down.</p><p>Lauryn is now living with Shawn, who has full custody of his daughter.</p><p><em>Unknown Number: The High School Catfish</em> is available to stream on Netflix now.</p>

      <p><strong>A Keanu Reeves movie dubbed 'cinematic perfection' has just landed on Netflix and fans cannot get enough of it.</strong></p><p>Mr <a href="https://www.unilad.com/john-wick" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>John Wick</em></a> himself is one of the most well-known actors in <a href="https://www.unilad.com/hollywood" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Hollywood</a>, having starred in countless successful movies over the years.</p><p>The actor's talent isn't just limited to <a href="https://www.unilad.com/film-and-tv" rel="noopener" target="_blank">film</a> appearances, however, as he has also appeared in the video game <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> in recent years.</p><p>A classic featuring <a href="https://www.unilad.com/keanu-reeves" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Reeves</a> has been the talk of the town on social media of late as it dropped on Netflix on Monday (September 1), some 33 years after it was released in theaters across the globe.</p><p>The 1992 film, directed by Francis Ford Coppola, is based on the classic novel by Bram Stoker - and reportedly saw <a href="https://www.unilad.com/celebrity/news/keanu-reeves-winona-ryder-wedding-608059-20240424" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Reeves and Winona Ryder accidentally marry each other</a>.</p><p><iframe style="width: 512px; height: 288px; background-color: black;" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen src="https://www.unilad.com/jw-iframe?videoId=1fU1Dy9M">﻿<span contenteditable="false"></span>﻿</iframe></p><p>I am, of course, talking about <em>Bram Stoker's Dracula</em>, which follows young barrister Jonathan Harker (Reeves) who is assigned to work in a village in eastern Europe.</p><p>However, he is soon captured and imprisoned by Dracula (Gary Oldman) who travels to London in search of Harker's fiancée, Mina Murray (Ryder).</p><p>Dracula then attempts to seduce and terrorize Mina's closest friend, Lucy Westenra (Sadie Frost), but as you'd expect with a <a href="https://www.unilad.com/horror" rel="noopener" target="_blank">horror</a> movie, things don't exactly go to plan.</p><p>While the film may be over 30 years old nowadays, some people will be watching it for the first time this week after its release on <a href="https://www.unilad.com/netflix" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Netflix</a>.</p><p>"Very bear to being Cinematic PERFECTION. One of my all-time favorite gothic horror films," one person penned in a review on Rotten Tomatoes.</p><p>A second added: "The Godfather of contemporary gothic horror and one of the best horror films of all time… even with some of the hackneyed actions from Ryder and Reeves."</p><p>While a third remarked: "The movie itself was brilliant and the closest adaptation of the novel."</p>

<p><em>Bram Stoker's Dracula</em> sits at a respectable 69 percent critics' score and a 79 percent audience score on Rotten Tomatoes, which suggests it's not a bad idea to stick on over the weekend.</p><p>The Philadelphia Inquirer's review <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-philadelphia-inquirer-bram-stokers/147395111/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">states</a>: "Truly, there is too much going on here, and the results are exhausting. At the same time, the film's very busyness is part of Dracula's undeniable charm. If there is glory in excess, Coppola's movie is glorious."</p><p>Meanwhile, The Telegraph <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/article/fort-worth-star-telegram-bram-stokers-d/147390490/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">wrote</a> in a mixed review: "The performances are top-notch, the set design is a wonder to behold and the cinematography is breathtaking. <em>Bram Stoker's Dracula</em> falls flat only in its failed attempt to faithfully - almost religiously - adapt to the novel."</p><p><em>Bram Stoker's Dracula </em>is available to stream on Netflix now.</p>

      <p><strong>More than 30,000 pages of records related to Jeffrey Epstein have been released by US officials following backlash over how the Trump administration has handled the files.</strong></p><p>The US House Oversight Committee released 33,295 pages of the heavily classified documents, including flight logs, jail surveillance video, court filings, audio recordings, and emails. </p><p>But it fell short at revealing the disgraced financier's alleged 'client list' - which<strong> </strong><a href="https://unilad.com/conspiracy-theories" rel="noopener" target="_blank">conspiracy theorists</a> believe the socialite kept a diary of people involved in his sex trafficking.</p><p>In July,<strong> </strong>an FBI<strong> </strong>and the Department of Justice (DOJ) memo was released, which said that the multi-millionaire <a href="https://www.unilad.com/news/us-news/jeffrey-epstein-how-he-died-fbi-conspiracy-theories-279849-20250707" rel="noopener" target="_blank">did not have a 'client list'</a> and there was 'no credible evidence' that <a href="https://www.unilad.com/jeffrey-epstein" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Epstein</a> had blackmail against any influential figures.</p><p>In February, however, US Attorney General Pam Bondi claimed to Fox News that the alleged list was 'sitting on my desk right now to review', though White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said Bondi was referring to a general list of <a href="https://www.unilad.com/crime" rel="noopener" target="_blank">crimes</a> relating to Epstein.</p><p>Oversight Committee Chair Republican James Comer has said the Department of Justice has informed him of its plans to continue to release additional records.</p>

<p>"This is the most thorough investigation into Epstein and Maxwell to date, and we are getting results," he said. "We have already deposed former Attorney General Bill Barr, the Department of Justice provided nearly 34,000 pages of documents, and will produce more, which are being made public as we speak."</p><p>However, the Democrats don't see it that way, as they've suggested that almost all the files have already been made public, with an initial review by the Oversight Committee Democrats finding that 3 per cent of the information included was new.</p><p>“Oversight Democrats find 97% of the more than 30,000 documents received from the Department of Justice were already public,” Congressman Robert Garcia said on Tuesday (September 2).</p><p>Comer himself also noted that there was 'nothing new in the documents' from what he could see, in an interview with NBC News. </p>

<p>One of the videos released features more footage of the night of Epstein's death outside his jail cell; however, when it was first released back in July, many were quick to pick up a 'missing minute' between 23:00 and 00:00 from the CCTV footage. </p><p><a href="https://www.unilad.com/news/us-news/jeffrey-epstein-missing-minute-video-footage-pam-bondi-978330-20250709" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Bondi previously said</a> that the missing minute was a result of the video being 'reset', and that 'every night should have the same minute missing'. </p><p>According <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cp949lrj373o" rel="noopener" target="_blank">to</a> the BBC, the 'missing minute' was not included in the 13-hour footage, however. </p><p>Republican representative of Kentucky, Thomas Massie, said his legislation requiring the DOJ to release its Epstein files within 30 days still has support from both Republicans and Democrats, as he said 'somebody needs to show us what's new in those documents' (<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/house-oversight-jeffrey-epstein-documents/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">via </a>CBS). </p>

      <p><strong>Fans of Netflix's <em>The Thursday Murder Club </em>should stream an 'absolutely gripping' series featuring David Tennant next. </strong></p><p>The <a href="https://www.unilad.com/film-and-tv" rel="noopener" target="_blank">movie</a> adaptation of Richard Osmond's best-selling novel made its <a href="https://www.unilad.com/netflix" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Netflix</a> debut on Thursday (August 28) and has shot to the top of the streamer's most-watched charts. </p><p>In the UK, it takes the number one spot, while in the <a href="https://www.unilad.com/us-news" rel="noopener" target="_blank">US</a> it's in second place, below true crime documentary <em>Unknown Number: </em><a href="https://www.unilad.com/film-and-tv/netflix/netflix-unknown-number-kendra-licari-munchausen-proxy-220811-20250902" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>The High School Catfish</em></a>.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.unilad.com/uk-news" rel="noopener" target="_blank">British</a> crime drama is set at the peaceful retirement village of Cooper’s Chase, where four unlikely friends - ex-spy Elizabeth Best (Helen Mirren), former trade union leader Ron Ritchie (Pierce Brosnan), retired psychiatrist Ibrahim Arif (Ben Kingsley) and former nurse Joyce Meadowcroft (Celia Imrie) - spend their Thursdays unraveling forgotten cold cases.</p><p>But when a brutal murder strikes disturbingly close to home, their hobby suddenly becomes deadly serious.</p>

<p>Behind the cozy teas and chatter lies a labyrinth of betrayal, cover-ups and justice long delayed.</p><p>Among the ensemble cast is also <em>Doctor Who </em>star David Tennant, who features in a top-rated Netflix series fans should be queuing up for their next binge-watch. While <em>The Thursday Murder Club </em>earned a <a href="https://www.unilad.com/rotten-tomatoes" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Rotten Tomatoes</a> score of 76 percent from critics, this two-season series averages at 92 percent.</p><p>The Netflix original - made up of seven episodes in total - released in 2019 with its second season following in 2020.</p><p>The show unfolds entirely within a handful of claustrophobic spaces: a police interrogation room, the adjoining observation area and a hallway, yet it still has fans 'gripped' with its tight script and psychological warfare.</p><p>Each episode introduces a new case and a new suspect, as a team of skilled Metropolitan Police interrogators probe for the truth in fiery, one-on-one exchanges.</p><p>Leading the squad is Detective Chief Inspector Natalie Hobbs (Katherine Kelly), while Tennant portrays a doctor of a different kind; one at the centre of a chilling murder investigation.</p>

<p>Other guest stars include <em>Mission: Impossible's </em>Hayley Atwell, <em>Big Bang Theory's </em>Kunal Nayyar and <em>Game of Thrones' </em>Kit Harington.</p><p>The show in question is called <em>Criminal: UK </em>and it's part of Netflix’s <em>Criminal</em> franchise, which also includes versions set in France, Germany and Spain.</p><p>Rotten Tomatoes critics said of the show's first season: "<em>Criminal</em>'s claustrophobic stylings and constantly twisting narratives pair nicely with its visual experiments, creating a crime drama that's equal parts creepy and captivating."</p><p>One fan agreed: "It’s impressive how much they were able to achieve with minimal changes in setting throughout the whole season. Excellent writing, acting and directing." </p><p>A second hailed the show 'absolutely gripping' as a third wrote: "Best viewing experience in a long time - see them all!"</p><p><iframe style="width: 512px; height: 288px; background-color: black;" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen src="https://www.unilad.com/jw-iframe?videoId=pUmolkjj">﻿<span contenteditable="false"></span>﻿</iframe></p><p>The praise continued over on <a href="https://www.unilad.com/google" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Google</a> reviews, where one fan even likened the show to <em>Mindhunter</em>,<em> </em>adding: "It seemed flawless to me. There is no action but as the detectives elicit confessions from suspects in the line room, every word and every scene is charged with meaning.</p><p>"The script is tight and without a single unnecessary sentence."</p><p>A second added: "Initially, I was expecting another two-dimensional police procedural, but after binge watching both (short!) seasons, I’m hooked."</p><p><em>Criminal: UK</em> is streaming now on Netflix.</p>

      <p><strong>A woman says she's been 'forced' into veganism after developing an unusual allergy that's increasing across the US.</strong></p><p>A health condition of nightmares for meat-loving <a href="https://www.unilad.com/us-news" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Americans</a> has been on the rise across the nation in recent months, forcing dozens to turn to a plant-based diet in the face of horrific itchiness and full-body hives.</p><p>For Daisy Holstine from <a href="https://www.unilad.com/arkansas" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Arkansas</a>, who admits she loves a Whopper burger, that nightmare became her reality as she developed a severe allergy to <a href="https://www.unilad.com/food-and-drink" rel="noopener" target="_blank">meat</a> and dairy seemingly out of the blue.</p><p><a href="https://nypost.com/2025/08/27/health/im-vegan-against-my-will-after-a-developing-a-meat-allergy-overnight/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Speaking</a> to The New York Post, the 36-year-old recalled: "I was waking up with my eyes swollen shut.</p><p>"The hives were all over my body, even on my scalp, my hands, the bottoms of my feet."</p><p>It took weeks for Daisy to get to the bottom of her mystery illness, which medics confirmed as alpha-gal syndrome (AGS), a once rare condition that has exploded across the country.</p>

<p>Why it's <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2023/p0727-emerging-tick-bites.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">increasing</a> is all to do with the lone star tick, a parasite that thrives in the heat and comes with a nasty bite that saddles its victims with a life-threatening allergy to meat and dairy.</p><p>These ticks are taking over far beyond their usual haunt in the Southeast, traveling as far as <a href="https://www.unilad.com/new-york" rel="noopener" target="_blank">New York</a> and Maine, which experts <a href="https://journals.plos.org/climate/article?id=10.1371/journal.pclm.0000528" rel="noopener" target="_blank">say</a> could be due to global warming cranking up the temperatures and extending their time to shine beyond the summer months.</p><p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/alpha-gal-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20428608" rel="noopener" target="_blank">According</a> to the Mayo Clinic, alpha-gal syndrome causes 'mild to intense' allergies to red meat and dairy products, and can even prompt anaphylactic reactions.</p><h2><strong>Daisy's initial symptoms</strong></h2><p>As for Daisy, she recalled first spotting a cluster of red patches on her skin when on a trip to Nashville in December.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.unilad.com/korea" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Korean</a> mother-of-two shrugged off the symptom as 'Asian glow' after drinking <a href="https://www.unilad.com/alcohol" rel="noopener" target="_blank">alcohol</a> and popped an antihistamine which saw it go away.</p><p>However, days later it reappeared and by the next weekend, she said she was 'hiving out'.</p><p>"They were everywhere," Daisy said.</p><p>As a remote nurse case manager with United <a href="https://www.unilad.com/health" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Healthcare</a>, Daisy said she was 'pretty vigilant about bugs' and was skeptical when a doctor suggested testing for AGS, particularly as she hadn't noticed a tick or any signs of a bite like the typical bulls-eye rash.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.unilad.com/parenting" rel="noopener" target="_blank">mom</a> also said she'd heard of the condition before and thought she would 'literally die' if she ever got that diagnosis.</p><p>"I’m a big red meat eater … if I’m going to a restaurant, I’m going to have a steak," she added.</p><h2><strong>"I could have cried getting that diagnosis"</strong></h2><p>Dermatologists then threw a spanner in the works by diagnosing her with chronic urticaria, or unexplained hives, which saw Daisy, driven by 'desperation' at this point, take on rounds of antihistamines, medication that suppresses the immune system and another powerful drug designed to treat cancer and autoimmune diseases.</p><p>The concoction made her feel lethargic while her hair fell out, and still no cure for the mystery hives.</p><p>Eventually, ChatGPT advised her to try the elimination diet, cutting out gluten and meat, which saw her hives disappear. Meanwhile, medics broke the news that she did have AGS.</p><p>"I could have cried getting that diagnosis," Daisy said. "We finally figured out what the heck was going on with me."</p><p>She added: "At this point, as a medical necessity, I went <a href="https://www.unilad.com/vegan" rel="noopener" target="_blank">vegan</a>."</p>

<h2><strong>"I can see the end in sight"</strong></h2><p>AGS doesn't trigger an allergic reaction to every animal product but Daisy found it easier to cut out everything than trawl through nutrition labels - even swapping her toothpaste and <a href="https://www.unilad.com/beauty" rel="noopener" target="_blank">cosmetics</a> to animal-free.</p><p>"That’s a big deal in Arkansas," she explained. "If you make that choice to be vegan for life, I think it’s very commendable, because it is not easy."</p><p>While there's no cure for AGS, Daisy is optimistic that Soliman Aurricular Allergy Treatment (SAAT) will help her reintroduce meat into her diet, which involves tiny needles being inserted into pressure points.</p><p>Daisy concluded: "I want a Whopper so bad, but it’s OK, I’m getting there.</p><p>"I can see the end in sight."</p>

<p>Holland added that he didn't 'know what the future looks like' and doesn't 'know the answers' to what could lie ahead.</p><p>“And I think the producers, at times were like, absolutely sick of me, but I think it's really important, because, you know, we make these movies for them, and I don't know what the future of it looks like," he continued.</p><p>“All I know is that right now, what we have and what we're working on is very bright, and I think it's going to be really fantastic. And it feels very different, fresh, profound and new, yeah, but in terms of, like, my future in the character beyond this film, I don't know the answers to that question.”</p><p>When asked if he could describe his ultimate role, he added: “As an actor, you know, I'm just blessed to be doing what I'm doing.</p><p>"Yeah, I'm not trying to be greedy in any way. I just walked on set yesterday for <em>Spider-Man</em> four, S<em>pider Man: Brand New Day</em>, as I should be saying, I just am loving it, and I'm lucky, and I don't want to ever be too greedy."</p>
