					<description><![CDATA[<p>Never have so many journalists been killed in a war and, even as global condemnation rises, little is being done to hold Israel to account</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Steve Witkoff, the United States Special Envoy to the Middle East, has <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gmrxd8ryno">said</a> that the White House is putting together a “very comprehensive plan” to end the war in Gaza. Donald Trump agreed, <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/25/trump-predicts-conclusive-ending-to-gaza-war-within-three-weeks-2">claiming</a> that “within the next two to three weeks” there would be a “pretty good, conclusive ending.” In the meantime, though, Israel has expanded its all-out assault on Gaza City, suspending aid operations even as the United Nations <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/08/1165726">declares</a> Gaza to be officially in the grip of a man-made famine. An Israeli spokesman <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/trump-administration-to-host-israeli-officials-for-talks-on-post-war-gaza">said</a> in Arabic that the evacuation of Gaza City was “inevitable”. The prospect of a ceasefire seems remote, though Qatari mediators have said Hamas has signed up to a ceasefire on terms nearly identical to those proposed by the U.S. and agreed to by Israel. But, as Trump has posted on Truth Social, Israel and the U.S. now <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/trump-hostages-will-only-be-released-when-hamas-is-confronted-and-destroyed/">believe</a> that only by destroying Hamas and taking over Gaza, can the release of hostages be secured.&nbsp;</p>





<p>It doesn’t appear to matter how many more civilians die in the meantime. “Israel values the work of journalists, medical staff, and all civilians,” Benjamin Netanyahu <a href="https://x.com/netanyahu/status/1960030187933835604">posted</a> on social media on August 25 responding to global condemnation following the deaths of five journalists in an attack on Nasser Hospital in Khan Yunis, in the southern Gaza Strip. Since the war in Gaza began in October, 2023, at least 197 journalists have been <a href="https://cpj.org/full-coverage-israel-gaza-war/">killed</a> according to the Committee to Protect Journalists which has described Israel’s actions as “the deadliest and most deliberate effort to kill and silence journalists that CPJ has ever documented.” Al Jazeera, the Qatari-based news network, puts the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/11/here-are-the-names-of-the-journalists-israel-killed-in-gaza">number</a> at over 270.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Italian prime minister Giorgia Meloni, speaking at a Catholic festival in Rimini, <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/meloni-war-in-gaza-has-gone-beyond-the-principle-of-proportionality/">said</a> the killings were “an unacceptable attack on press freedom and on all those who risk their lives to report the tragedy of war.” British prime minister Keir Starmer called the bombing in Khan Yunis “completely indefensible.” On X, the German foreign ministry <a href="https://x.com/GermanyDiplo/status/1960008967947710540">said</a> it had “repeatedly called on the Israeli government to allow immediate independent foreign media access and afford protection for journalists operating in Gaza.” Spain described it as “a flagrant and unacceptable violation of international humanitarian law.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Given the near universal condemnation, will anything be done to hold Israel to account? “More governments are showing a willingness in recent months to call out Israel for its failure to protect journalists and to call for transparent investigations into their killings,” said Jodie Ginsberg, the chief executive of the Committee to Protect Journalists. “But,” she told Coda, “they still stop short on taking any concrete measures - such as sanctions, or conditions on trade agreements or weapons sales - that could force Israel to uphold its obligations under international law.”</p>



<p>Earlier this month, on August 10, Al Jazeera journalist Anas al-Sharif, was killed in Gaza City alongside several of his colleagues. Israel admitted to targeting al-Sharif, describing him as “masquerading” as a journalist. “A terrorist is a terrorist,” Israeli diplomats <a href="https://new.embassies.gov.il/multilateral-organizations-france/en/news/idf-eliminates-hamas-terrorist-masquerading-al-jazeera-journalist-gaza-city-august-10-2025">said</a>, “even if Al Jazeera gave him a press badge.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to intelligence sources who <a href="https://www.972mag.com/israel-gaza-journalists-hamas-hasbara/">spoke</a> to Israeli publication +972 Magazine, the IDF established a special “Legitimization Cell” after October 7, tasked not with security operations but with gathering intelligence to bolster Israel's media image. The unit specifically sought to identify Gaza-based journalists it could portray as Hamas operatives, driven by anger that Palestinian reporters were “smearing Israel's name in front of the world.” Whenever global criticism intensified over the killing of journalists, the cell was instructed to find intelligence that could publicly counter the narrative. "If the global media is talking about Israel killing innocent journalists, then immediately there's a push to find one journalist who might not be so innocent—as if that somehow makes killing the other 20 acceptable," one intelligence source told +972 Magazine. Intelligence gathered was passed directly to American officials through special channels, with officers told that their work was vital to allowing Israel to continue the war without international pressure.</p>



<p>In its initial inquiry into Monday’s bombing of Nasser Hospital in Khan Yunis, Israel <a href="https://www.gov.il/en/pages/conclusion-of-the-initial-inquiry-regarding-the-incident-of-the-strike-on-the-hospital-in-khan-yunis-26-aug-2025">claimed</a> a camera at the hospital was “being used to observe the activity of IDF troops, in order to direct terrorist activities against them.” International journalists have no independent access to Gaza. It would be, Ginsberg said, “one way to help force a change in the narrative being pushed by Israel that all Gazan journalists are terrorist operatives and therefore none can be trusted.” Ginsberg told Coda that of the cases of journalists and media workers killed by Israel, CPJ has so far “deemed 26 to be deliberate targeting… these are the cases where we are clear that Israel would have known the individuals killed were journalists and nevertheless targeted them.”</p>





<p>Journalists, as civilians, are protected under international law. Targeting them is a war crime. Yet, Ginsberg notes, since “international journalists and human rights investigators do not have access to Gaza,” it has “hampered documentation.” And “more disturbingly,” she added, “the dehumanization of Gazan journalists and Gazans more generally means there has not been the collective outrage that should accompany any killing let alone killings of this magnitude.”<br><br>Israel has already said that the deaths of journalists in the attack on Nasser Hospital were a "tragic mishap" that resulted from legitimate security operations. The recent UN Security Council vote on an immediate ceasefire (14 out of 15 members supporting, only the U.S. withholding) signals Israel’s growing isolation. But American support is all Israel needs to continue its war. As the killings of journalists continue to be explained away, without evidence, as the killing of terrorists, the window for independent reporting in Gaza has likely closed. The systematic targeting of Gazan journalists isn't collateral damage, it's strategic silencing ahead of what may be the war's final phase.</p>

<p>Philanthropist is a great word, deriving as it does from an ancient Greek term for “love of humankind”. In theory it could describe almost any decent person but, in practice, it is reserved for very rich people – Mackenzie Scott, Bill Gates, Roger Federer – who demonstrate that love by spending lots of money.</p>



<p>It is incredibly odd how much <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-52833706">hate</a> Gates gets, considering the volume of crucial medical research that is being <a href="https://www.gatesfoundation.org/about/committed-grants">funded</a> by his foundation. And he has also pushed for other billionaires to give their wealth away, via 2010’s <a href="https://www.givingpledge.org/about-the-giving-pledge/">Giving Pledge</a> that he made alongside Warren Buffett, but if you thought that meant our new breed of oligarchs was chucking money out the door faster than it came in, a<a href="https://ips-dc.org/report-giving-pledge-at-15/"> new report</a> has worrying news.</p>



<p>“Three quarters of the original U.S. Giving Pledgers who are still alive remain billionaires today, and they have collectively gotten far&nbsp;<em>wealthier</em>&nbsp;since they signed, while just eight of 22 deceased Pledgers fulfilled their pledges. What’s more, most of these contributions have gone to private foundations or donor-advised funds (DAFs), which can warehouse wealth for years without paying it out to working charities,” concluded the Institute for Policy Studies.</p>

<p>Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan, who <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-tech-billionaires-who-signed-giving-pledge-donating-money-2018-7">signed</a> the pledge, have seen their wealth increase by 4,000 percent since 2010, which – if nothing else – suggests they were not very good at giving money away even before their recent decision to <a href="https://fortune.com/article/chan-zuckerberg-initiative-school-shut-down/">close</a> tuition-free schools they’ve been funding.</p>



<p>In this they are not alone: billionaire wealth is increasing globally, growing three times faster than the rate of inflation, while hundreds of millions of people live extremely precarious lives, and life expectancy has begun to fall even in some wealthy countries.</p>



<p>I don’t want to give the impression I am opposed to charitable giving by rich people. The <a href="https://wellcome.org/">Wellcome Trust</a> (created by Henry Wellcome before World War Two) does incredible work, as do many other organisations founded by past tycoons. But I do think that the modern-day iteration of philanthropy gives an impression of generosity, which is almost always not matched in reality.</p>



<p>The most extreme example recently is that of Sam Bankman-Fried, who yakked on to anyone that would listen about <a href="https://www.effectivealtruism.org/">effective altruism</a>, a movement which is perhaps the perfect distillation of the neoliberal version of philanthropy, while running <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-68677487">a gigantic fraud</a>. But, even in cases of law-abiding tycoons, the impression of generosity takes the pressure off them to pay the taxes needed to support democratic societies.</p>



<p>The IFS says “instead of allowing the ultra-wealthy to park trillions for generations in family-controlled foundations and intermediaries such as donor-advised funds, we must strengthen the rules that currently allow them to use these vehicles for tax avoidance”, and I couldn’t agree more.</p>



<p>A lot of problems cannot be solved by just throwing money at them: hiring a nanny is not equivalent to being a parent; paying for a therapist is no replacement for being a friend; giving donations to organisations is not the same as being a citizen. I understand that this must be annoying for a billionaire to pay a huge amount of tax and then watch it being spent on something you don’t agree with, but that’s something we all have to put up with in a democracy. If you don’t like it, there are plenty of countries out there with other political systems you could try; or else, you can try to persuade people to vote for you. Of course, Zuckerberg did think about trying that, and you really should read about it in ‘Careless People’. It’s hilarious.</p>



<p><strong>THE WHITE HOUSE ABANDONS HUMAN RIGHTS?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>A couple of months ago, the foreign ministries of Russia and Belarus released their <a href="https://mid.ru/en/foreign_policy/reports/2028846/">joint report</a> on the “Human Rights Situation in Certain Countries”. Now I feel sure that all readers of this newsletter will have already perused this document’s 1,500-odd pages in depth, but just in case you haven’t, it’s basically a deeply weird attempt to insist that the world’s most pressing question remains World War Two, and therefore the worst problems occur in those countries that object to having been occupied by the Soviet Union.</p>



<p>As far as I can tell, Moscow started producing this report not because it cares about human rights (if it does, it has a strange way of showing it) but because it deeply objected to the fact the U.S. State Department had for decades published its own annual report accusing Russia of mistreating its own citizens, and the Kremlin wanted to get its own back. The difference between the two reports of course was that the American one was respected and authoritative and the Russia one was absurd.</p>



<p>Respected and authoritative that was until last week, when the <a href="https://www.state.gov/reports/2024-country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/">2024 US reports</a> were published with many of the same flaws as the Russian ones have long had. “Entire categories of interest were removed. The Obama administration had previously put a strong focus on corruption, on the grounds that kleptocracy and autocracy are deeply linked,” <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/08/trump-state-department-human-rights-report/683852/?gift=hVZeG3M9DnxL4CekrWGK35JYnnZ3WHTj2r6mmM3Qn9M&amp;utm_source=copy-link&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=share">noted</a> Anne Applebaum. “The revisions also go much further than expected, dropping references to corruption, restrictions on free and fair elections, rights to a fair trial, and the harassment of human-rights organisations.”</p>



<p>Citizens of countries less fortunate than the United States had long relied on the State Department’s reports for support in their campaigns against their own governments, often against huge odds. This is just the latest example of the White House abandoning people who had previously depended on it.</p>



<p><strong>AN EDUCATION IN SANCTIONS EVASION</strong></p>



<p>While I’m talking about Russia, I recommend this <a href="https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/teaching-business-and-art-sanctions-circumvention">article</a> by Tom Keatinge on how universities are now teaching courses in sanctions evasion. Indeed, in one Moscow university, the course is compulsory for law students.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The Kremlin views itself as being at economic war with the West, thus requiring a whole-of-society response including training future generations in the art of sanctions circumvention and new approaches to cross-border payments that avoid the US dollar and other western currencies. The counterparts of the troops being thrown into the meatgrinder in Eastern Ukraine are the businessmen, accountants and financiers learning these new tools,” Keatinge writes.</p>



<p>It is very frustrating to me that we in the West are not working to defend our values as seriously as people in Moscow are working to undermine them.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Trump’s Alaska summit was more than diplomatic theater, it exposed how authoritarians weaponize our collective amnesia to reshape narratives and seize control</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Even as Zelensky and his European allies descended on Washington, I found myself still processing what we had witnessed just days earlier in Alaska, where Putin and Trump turned crisis into theater, and where Putin issued a seductive invitation to step "from yesterday into tomorrow."</p>



<p>Put aside memories, responsibility, and accountability, he suggested. Drift into business as usual.</p>





<p>Every summer, when news slows to a languid crawl, journalists trade a well-worn joke: just wait, August will deliver its crisis. This August, the crisis came packaged as theater: a spectacle in Alaska with Trump and Putin center stage, military helicopters overhead, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in his intentionally provocative "USSR" sweatshirt and a swarm of media chasing every move.</p>



<p>Putin basked in his return from international isolation. Trump beamed as he applauded him. As far as we know, they achieved nothing. The summit wrapped up with vague platitudes..</p>



<p>I felt anger swell inside me as I watched the spectacle. Not at Putin or Trump, who are expertly playing the roles they have chosen for themselves, but at the rest of us who keep letting them get away with it.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Media's Unwilling Complicity</strong></h2>



<p>In coverage of the Alaska summit, report after report on US television referred to Ukraine as "the war that started in 2022," echoing a narrative that strips away years of conflict, occupation, and loss. What Putin and Trump are successfully inviting us to forget isn't just the past, but the throughline of consequences that have brought us to this moment.</p>





<p>Our recent <a href="https://www.codastory.com/rewriting-history/why-georgias-national-memory-is-on-trial/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">investigation</a> exposes the anatomy of how authoritarians manipulate not just history but living memory itself: how the tweaking of tiny details, the quiet adjustment of timelines or the reframing of a single moment can change the entire story.</p>



<p>For me, the story is deeply personal. In 2008, Vladimir Putin carried out his first invasion of a sovereign state: Georgia. I flew home to cover the war for the BBC, filing updates on Russian troop movements, statements from officials, and frontline reports.</p>



<p>But my reports, no matter how thorough, sat within the BBC's larger narrative of the Georgia war as a sudden, out-of-the-blue August crisis. This narrative completely ignored the reality that for those living it, the war was simply the latest catastrophic chapter in Russia's decades-long campaign of aggression.</p>



<p>This is the paradox of news: one of society's essential pillars, designed to inform, yet structurally unable to capture the very continuity that defines how people experience life. The pressures are real: audience attention spans, commercial demands, the sheer volume of breaking news, but the effect remains the same. It makes news media, even well-intentioned, ethical media, an unwilling accomplice to authoritarian manipulation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Architecture of Forgetting</strong></h2>



<p>All of us understand our lives in context: in relation to history, memory, and culture. For Palestinians, today's violence is inseparable from the Nakba of 1948, the catastrophe that started their displacement. For Ukrainians, the conflict didn't begin in 2022. For Georgians, the war was never just five days long. For the Sudanese, the current war isn't separate from decades of Darfur's trauma.</p>



<p>When the news machine reduces these stories to start dates and breaking news alerts, it strips them of crucial continuity. It is precisely in these interrupted threads, these gaps where collective memory should live, that authoritarians find their opportunity.</p>



<p>Authoritarians operate in the spaces left empty by our collective forgetting, reshaping narratives and bending truth to serve their aims.</p>



<p>"I'm looking around, looking for a homeland inside my homeland," says one woman in Masho's piece, capturing the alienation spreading across societies where people are forced to give up not only their land but also their stories and memories, their truth.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>There has been much <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/whats-the-trump-administrations-dollar-strategy-it-depends-on-who-you-ask/">speculation</a> in financial circles that the White House’s erratic policymaking, random tariffs, and general shoot-from-the-hip approach could undermine the global role of the dollar, which could perhaps be replaced by the euro. I have no insight into that but I am confident that Europe’s single currency won’t replace greenbacks as criminals’ favourite money laundering tool any time soon.</p>



<p>Ordinary people are using cash money less and less in everyday life, so logically the amount of banknotes in circulation should be falling. Particularly at a time of high inflation, when a non-interest-bearing form of money is losing value all the time. This is what is happening in the eurozone, where the value of cash in circulation hit its all-time high in June 2022 of <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/policy_and_exchange_rates/banknotes+coins/circulation/html/index.en.html">€1,602.6 billion</a>, which was €16.2 billion more than the total today.</p>





<p>In the United States, on the other hand, the total number of dollars in circulation hits a new high every month, and in July <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CURRCIR">reached</a> $2,399.538 billion. That is an increase of $121.6 billion since June 2022, or just over five percent. The only people willing to hold paper currency when inflation is high are people who have a compelling reason not to care, and I think the only significant group of people that meet that requirement are criminals who seek anonymity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So while financial markets may find an alternative to the mighty dollar, at least the United States can count on the continued custom of the world’s criminals. Interestingly, the pound is behaving more like the dollar than the euro, with the total in circulation having <a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/boeapps/database/fromshowcolumns.asp?Travel=NIxAZxSUx&amp;FromSeries=1&amp;ToSeries=50&amp;DAT=RNG&amp;FD=1&amp;FM=Jan&amp;FY=2002&amp;TD=31&amp;TM=Dec&amp;TY=2027&amp;FNY=Y&amp;CSVF=TT&amp;html.x=66&amp;html.y=26&amp;SeriesCodes=RPWB55A,RPWB56A,RPWB59A,RPWB67A,RPWZ4TJ,RPWZ4TK,RPWZOQ4,RPWZ4TL,RPWZ4TM,RPWZOI7,RPWZ4TN&amp;UsingCodes=Y&amp;Filter=N&amp;title=Bank%20of%20England%20Weekly%20Report&amp;VPD=Y">increased </a>by 5.9 percent since June 2022 to £93.6 billion. And the same is true of the Canadian dollar (<a href="https://www.bankofcanada.ca/rates/banking-and-financial-statistics/bank-of-canada-assets-and-liabilities-month-end-formerly-b1/">up three percent</a>). So I suppose an alternative explanation is that criminals just like speaking English?</p>



<p><strong>BANKS CAN’T CLOSE CRYPTO BACKDOOR&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Of course one of the drivers of the dollar’s supposed decline is America’s geopolitical rivals creating new payment mechanisms outside of the Western system. Iran, under severe sanctions, has sought to create new routes for money to flow and the United States – including as recently as last week – has tried to <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sb0220">stop</a> that from happening.</p>



<p>“As a result of President Trump’s maximum pressure campaign and increasing isolation from the global financial system, the Iranian regime is running out of places to hide,” said&nbsp;Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent.&nbsp;“Treasury will continue to disrupt Iran’s schemes aimed at evading our sanctions, block its access to revenue, and starve its weapons programs of capital in order to protect the American people.”</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Trump has signed an executive order <a href="https://cryptobriefing.com/debanking-executive-order-trump/">stopping</a> the previous practice of encouraging banks from being highly sceptical of crypto clients, much to the delight of said clients. “It used to be that corresponding banks&nbsp;in the US block transactions involving crypto (fiat for buying crypto). This opens banking for crypto internationally,” <a href="https://x.com/cz_binance/status/1952533764883829148">tweeted</a> Changpeng Zhao, founder of the giant Binance exchange.</p>



<p>But what does this mean for Iran? Iranians were already using crypto to evade sanctions, despite efforts by some of the better-connected companies to <a href="https://fincrimecentral.com/tether-wallet-freeze-iranian-sanctions-tron/">keep</a> a lid on them.</p>



<p>“Iran’s government maintains extensive control over the country’s financial system, including cryptocurrency infrastructure,” <a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/crypto-crime-sanctions-2025/">concluded</a> Chainalysis in an analysis published earlier this year. “Cryptocurrency represents an alternative financial system, and the increasing use of Iranian crypto exchanges suggests that more individuals and institutions are resorting to crypto to safeguard wealth and circumvent financial restrictions.”</p>



<p>I’m struggling to think of an analogy for what the U.S. government is doing here in its policy towards Iran’s illicit financial flows. By sanctioning the Cross-Border Interbank Messaging System used by Iranians, it’s shutting the door, but by banning U.S. banks from doing due diligence on crypto companies, it’s demolishing the wall.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>AN ATTACK OF CONSCIENCE</strong></p>



<p>British real estate has been the investment of choice for kleptocrats for years, thanks to the country’s toothless regulators, conscience-free lawyers, and biddable politicians. But the war in Ukraine created much soul-searching in Britain about what exactly its approach had enabled, and a long-overdue re-examination of the system finally began, with – apparently – actual real-world<a href="https://solicitorstribunal.org.uk/case/12560/"> consequences</a>.</p>



<p>“British lawyer Rory Fordyce has been ordered to pay £32,500 for failing to adequately vet funds linked to the family of Azerbaijan’s former security chief,” reports the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP). “In addition to the fine, Fordyce was barred from holding any legal management or compliance roles for five years and was ordered to pay £50,000 in legal costs.” And as if that wasn’t enough for the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal, a specialised court that brings cases against certain kinds of lawyers, it has also decided to <a href="https://www.sra.org.uk/consumers/solicitor-check/020940/">prosecute</a> another lawyer for making <a href="https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2023-12-01/carter-ruck-britains-fiercest-libel-firm-will-pursue-anyone-anywhere-reputation">threats</a> against people criticising the huge Ponzi scheme OneCoin, after detailed allegations were <a href="https://taxpolicy.org.uk/2023/12/18/carter-ruck-acted-for-fraudster/">made</a> by the Tax Policy Associates.</p>



<p>“Solicitors aren’t Daleks. We have ethical and professional obligations. We’re not permitted to act for an obvious fraud and threaten people who call out the fraud,” <a href="https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2025-08-06/carter-ruck-partner-prosecuted-for-improper-threat-to-sue">said</a> TPA founder Dan Neidle.</p>



<p>The lawyer in question – Claire Gill of Carter-Ruck – denies any wrongdoing, and Carter-Ruck has promised to mount a vigorous defence. Still, hopefully this will encourage lawyers to be more diligent in checking the bona fides of their clients.</p>



<p><strong>THIEVING OLIGARCHS</strong></p>



<p>I’m sure many of the readers of this newsletter have read Richard Wilkinson’s and Kate Pickett’s ‘The Spirit Level’, published in 2009, with its thorough and convincing analysis of why inequality is bad for individuals and societies. I remember reading it at the time and thinking it could change the world but sadly that does not seem to have happened.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now Pickett is back with a series of <a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/inequalities/2025/08/05/the-wealth-gap-and-the-health-trap/">blogs</a> for the London School of Economics, starting with powerful posts on the environment, and health. There’s so much to think about in the global debate around oligarchy, and it’s easy to forget that it’s all about ordinary people’s lives, and how they are stunted when others cheat them of what should be theirs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The picture is as tragic as it is clear regarding the gap between rich and poor and how this connects with myriad physical and mental health conditions,” <a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/inequalities/2025/08/05/the-wealth-gap-and-the-health-trap/">she writes</a>. “Countries with higher levels of income inequality are associated with higher rates of adult obesity and child overweightness, diabetes, mental illness, asthma, drug use and infant mortality.”</p>

<figure class="wp-block-video alignfull"><video autoplay loop muted src="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/DejZgOeP/masho_cover-final.mov" playsinline></video></figure>



<p>On August 7, 2008, Maguli Okropiridze, almost nine months pregnant, fled her village of Ergneti in the Georgian region of South Ossetia.</p>



<p>For Maguli, who had become used to a life lived in the backdrop of bullets and artillery shells, it took a week of heavy shelling to push her out of her home. She had finally decided to flee what was now a war zone. But the stress of evacuating herself and her four children sent her into labour. With just a quarter of an hour to go before midnight, in a hospital in the small nearby town of Gori, Maguli gave birth to a baby girl, Keto.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just two days later, on August 9, Russian planes began bombing Gori. Maguli, still dressed in a hospital gown, grabbed her newborn daughter and, without hesitation, jumped out of the second floor window.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignleft size-large is-resized"><img src="https://www.codastory.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/maguli-728x1200.png" alt="" class="wp-image-57922" style="width:374px;height:auto"/></figure>



<p>"Keto is as old as the war", Maguli told me. “Every year on her birthday, I first mourn and then I congratulate her”.</p>



<p>Like Maguli, many Georgians believe the war began on August 7, when Russian troops crossed into South Ossetia. In Moscow, the start of the war is said to be August 8, when Russian troops apparently responded to Georgia’s shelling of Tskhinvali, 30 kilometers from Gori and now the capital of disputed South Ossetia. But Maguli’s own government disagrees with her.</p>



<p>In the ruling party’s version of events, the Russo-Georgian war broke out on August 8, just as the Kremlin says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A day’s difference might seem minor, but it flips the script. It reverses the roles between victims and perpetrators. It changes how Georgians will describe the war to future generations. And it calls into question the national memory and, in part, Georgia’s national identity.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">When I was 10-years-old, wondering why fighter jets were hovering in the skies above us, my grandmother told me that Russia had invaded Georgia and annexed 20% of the country. I’d stand behind her chair, as the women gathered in her kitchen would curse Russia between sips of tea. Many had sons who were on the front line. These women, whose words I absorbed, are now being told that it wasn’t Russia’s fault that their sons had to go into battle. Since 2012, when Georgian Dream came to power, the party has maintained that its predecessors brought the war upon themselves by provoking Vladimir Putin.</p>



<p>As recently as April this year, Georgia’s prime minister told a government-friendly TV station that the 2008 war was the fault of former president Mikheil Saakashvili, acting on orders issued by a shadowy, nefarious Western cabal. The Georgian government has authorized a public commission to investigate “the circumstances surrounding the start of the 2008 war in South Ossetia,” particularly the role of the former government, the party of war as Georgian Dream characterizes it, while referring to itself as the party of peace even as it has spent months brutally suppressing street protests since October last year.</p>



<p>My country is now effectively putting itself on trial, 17 years after suffering an invasion from a foreign force.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video autoplay loop muted src="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/fKnBIR8I/masho.mov" playsinline></video></figure>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Georgia, a tiny country in the Caucasus region, wedged between eastern Europe and western Asia, has always been at a crossroads. For centuries, its location along the Silk Road brought both prosperity and peril, with invaders chasing the same riches that trade delivered.</p>



<p>For the past 200 years, the invader has been Russia. And resistance against those invasions has formed a core part of Georgian identity. “For us, the field in which we have lived is non-traditional and foreign,” noted the Georgian philosopher Merab Mamardashvili. This, he added, “is the field of Russian power which took shape, let us say, around the 17th century and reached its culmination under Soviet rule. The main idea of this field is that the state stands above all, and the person is nothing more than a servant of the state and of the state’s idea.”</p>



<p>The stories of Russian conquests and local defiance show up in textbooks, films, and casual dinner conversation not just as historical events, but as a lens through which the present is understood.</p>



<p>For much of Georgian society, the effort to preserve the memory of Russia’s past aggressions is about staying alert to patterns and remembering the lessons that help us make sense of what it means to live next to a former colonial master that never truly left. In the words of the writer Grigol Robakidze, “no one has inflicted as much harm – moral and intellectual harm – as Russia has.” The Russians, he wrote, “once they came to Georgia, immediately reached into the very soul of the Georgian people and set about corrupting it, erasing its uniqueness.”</p>



<p>It is this antipathy and foundational mistrust that the current government of Georgia must contend with as it sets about rewriting the story of the 2008 Russo-Georgian war.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.codastory.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2148996498-1530x1200.png" alt="" class="wp-image-58019"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">View of Tbilisi, 1850s.

<p class="has-drop-cap">At 27, I have lived under the same government for nearly half my life. And every protest I’ve ever attended against this government (and there have been many) has, in some way, circled back to Russia. The Kremlin’s reach, most protestors agree, extends to the highest levels of the Georgian government.</p>



<p>Georgian Dream emerged in 2012 as an alternative to the pro-western Saakashvili’s increasingly authoritarian rule. It had momentum and money to spend. Founded and funded by the oligarch Bidzina Ivanishvili, who made his billions in Russia's post-Soviet maelstrom, the party promised citizens democracy, stability, and integration into the European Union and NATO.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While many were wary of Ivanishvili’s intentions, given his background and ties to Russia, citizens were ready for change and his party emerged as the only viable option after absorbing much of the disjointed opposition.</p>



<p>The story of Ivanishvili’s authoritarian takeover is familiar across post-Soviet republics. A billionaire appears out of nowhere, cloaked in populist promises about creating wealth, stability, and in Ivanishvili’s case, giving away literal ‘free money’. He wins, and then begins to capture state institutions one by one. Only then does he reveal the long game – absolute power. By the time the public sees the full picture, the tools they might use to push back have already been taken away.</p>

<p>During its first term, and even for several years after, Georgian Dream largely maintained the appearance of a somewhat democratic, West-facing government. It was a necessary performance in a country where the overwhelming majority of citizens support Euro-Atlantic integration, and where openly pro-Russian politicians have had little to no chance of mainstream success.</p>



<p>My own doubts about Georgian Dream started around two years into its rule. I was 17, interning at a fact-checking organisation. It was 2015, the year when Russia’s ‘borderization’ policy was at its peak.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Borderization was a euphemism for what was basically a land grab, the slow but inexorable expansion of Russian territory within Georgia. Russian forces, often in the middle of the night, would move fences or put up new “border” signs, inching the occupation line further into Georgia. Sometimes it was a few meters, sometimes more. Either way, people would lose access to their farmland, water, and sometimes wake up to a completely different reality, with their house now inside occupied territory, unable to access the ‘Georgian side’.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.codastory.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/border-1800x1013.png" alt="" class="wp-image-58051"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">(L) Wire barricades erected by Russian and Ossetian troops along Georgia's de-facto border with its breakaway region of South Ossetia on July 14, 2015.

<p>One day, I was tasked to fact-check a <a href="https://tabula.ge/ge/news/576901-khidasheli-saokupatsio-zolis-gadmocevaze-araperi">quote</a> from then-Defense Minister, Tina Khidasheli. She said: “20% of our country is occupied, and if Russians move the ‘border’ by two kilometers, it’s bad, but it’s also just a continuation of the same political line that has been happening in the country for a long time.”</p>



<p>I remember being baffled by this. For two reasons. First because she referred to the occupation line as a border. If you call the occupation line a border then you’re legitimizing it, you’re going along with Russia’s talking points. And second because she made it sound like moving the line by two kilometers was nothing, but try telling that to the people who went to bed in Georgia and woke up in Russia, or at least subject to Russia’s rules..&nbsp;</p>



<p>This was my first sign that the government was softening its stance on occupation. But folks older than me remember pro-Russian rhetoric surfacing even earlier.</p>



<p>For instance in 2013, Ivanishvili <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxDaM95vk3k">claimed</a> Russia was not, in his view, an imperial nation interested in rebuilding its empire.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I don’t think and I don’t believe that Russia's strategy is to conquer and occupy the territories of neighboring countries. I don't believe that,” he told an interviewer and then went on to boast about his superior analytical skills.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The same year, he <a href="https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/analyses/2013-04-17/georgia-war-2008-subject-a-political-struggle#:~:text=On%2010%20April%2C%20Georgia's%20Prime,the%20course%20of%20the%20conflict.">spoke</a> of forming an “investigative commission” on the causes and triggers of the 2008 war. In 2018, during the presidential election, the Georgian Dream-backed candidate, Salome Zurabishvili claimed that Georgia had started the 2008 war and even suggested the previous government may have struck a covert deal with Russia.</p>





<p>In the face of a swift backlash from the public, most Georgian Dream politicians either avoided commenting on the matter or distanced themselves from Zurabishvili’s remarks. Tea Tsulukiani, the Justice Minister at the time, even said: “Georgia’s position is singular and unchanged: it is the position we present in Strasbourg and at The Hague: that Russia started the war against Georgia.”</p>



<p>But in the years that followed, that “singular and unchanged” position would very much change.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the international community eventually understood Russia’s 2008 invasion of Georgia to be a dress rehearsal for the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 – a connection the world failed to heed in 2014 – Tbilisi took the opposite tack. On the international stage, criticism of Russia was avoided, and Georgian officials blamed NATO’s eastern expansion for provoking Moscow into war.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Back home, Georgian Dream doubled down on a <a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/global-war--party-georgian-dream-bidzina-ivanishvili/32951749.html">worldview</a> seemingly lifted straight from the Kremlin.</p>



<p>In this world, every critic, every opposition party, and every Western-backed NGO or media outlet was just another node in a vast international plot. Georgian Dream officials and affiliated media claimed that the entire opposition was controlled by Saakashvili and his party, the United National Movement, which took its orders from a “global war party”&nbsp; run by elites in Brussels and Washington.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The goal? To create a submissive regime in Georgia which would realize the elites’ covert plans to drag Georgia into war with Russia and open another front in a perpetual war against the Kremlin. On the civic front, these same Western elites were working to erase Georgian culture — to undermine the church and traditional values, and to advance a “liberal ideology” which includes “gay propaganda.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Georgian Dream, rather like Vladimir Putin does for the world at large, casts itself as the last line of defense in Georgia, a guardian of peace and sovereignty and traditional values. And for these reasons, they claim, the West, particularly the EU, wants them gone.</p>



<p>And while the phrase “global war party” originated in Russian propaganda, similar rhetoric is part of a wider, international authoritarian playbook. When Georgian Dream saw a familiar narrative about globalist elites gaining ground in Donald Trump’s America, it rebranded its “global war party” as the “deep state”.&nbsp; Soon after, soundbites from U.S. politicians began appearing regularly in propaganda outlets.</p>



<p>In the run-up to the 2024 parliamentary elections, Georgian Dream’s central promise was peace with Russia. Fearmongering about war <a href="https://oc-media.org/georgian-dream-launches-campaign-ads-using-images-of-war-torn-ukraine/">saturated</a> the media landscape. And this is when the narrative turned once again to 2008.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.codastory.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2180423666-1800x1200.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-57935"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Founder of the ruling Georgian Dream party Bidzina Ivanishvili and Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze during a gathering at the party's headquarters in Tbilisi on October 26, 2024.

<p>Party officials said that the same Western cabal that had manipulated Saakashvili into war with Russia was at work again. Georgian Dream <a href="https://1tv.ge/news/qartuli-ocneba-dghes-sazogadoebam-kidev-ertkhel-ikhila-nacmodzraobis-farisevluri-piarkampania-yvelafers-ise-utifrad-aketeben-titqos-2008-wels-datrialebul/">campaigned</a> on prosecuting Saakashvili for his “well-planned treason”. Then, Bidzina Ivanishvili <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/georgias-most-powerful-man-suggests-an-apology-2008-war-with-russia-2024-09-15/">declared</a> that Georgia should apologize for the war.</p>



<p>This story became central to the state-sanctioned version of recent history, one in which Russia was recast not as the aggressor, but as a misunderstood neighbor. And Saakashvili was not a flawed leader defeated in elections, but a Western puppet. And the 2008 war not as an invasion, but a provocation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Given the violently contested election results and rampant allegations of fraud, it’s hard to measure how effective Georgian Dream’s historical revisionism was. But in December 2024, a large part of Georgian society made its position clear: when Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze <a href="https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2024/11/28/georgian-prime-minister-suspends-eu-membership-talks-until-end-of-2028">announced</a> Georgia was halting its EU accession negotiations for four years, the response was immediate.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.codastory.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2187807633-1800x1051.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-57999"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Anti-government protest on December 5, 2024, in Tbilisi, Georgia. Vlada Liberova/Libkos/Getty Images.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Outraged, Georgians flooded the streets demanding a reversal of the decision in what became the largest protests in the country’s modern history.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The government responded with an unprecedented crackdown.</p>



<p>In just six months, the no longer independent courts passed reams of repressive laws, citizens were brutally beaten by police not only at the protests but also on their own doorsteps, and attacks on independent media and civil society organizations intensified. More than 60 political prisoners now face long jail terms, and at least eight prominent opposition politicians are already behind bars.</p>



<p>Yet, while the already tight authoritarian screws in Georgia have been further tightened, Ivanishvili has not yet engineered a full ideological takeover. The battle over Georgia’s minds and collective memory is still being fought.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For more than 250 days, Georgians have been fighting to preserve their versions of the truth and for their visions of the country’s future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The view outside my windows in Tbilisi reflects that fight. In just the last year, the building in front of me now features a portrait of Maro Makashvili, a teenage nurse killed in the 1921 Soviet invasion of Georgia. A neighboring building features a mural of Giorgi Antsukhelidze, a Georgian soldier tortured by Russians during the 2008 war. And a third building features Georgian and Ukrainian flags.</p>



<p>This isn’t just a fight against authoritarianism for many of us. It’s the latest episode in a 200-year struggle against Russian imperialism and it’s a struggle for the rights of Georgians to write our past and, by extension, our future.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.codastory.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Masho-1709x1200.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-57967"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Portrait of Maro Makashvili, Tbilisi, Georgia, 2025. Masho Lomashvili.</figcaption></figure>



<p class="has-drop-cap">As the 2008 war once again became a staple of daily conversations, I found myself drawn into discussions about assigning blame. What surprised me most was hearing even those who regularly protest against the government repeat Georgian Dream’s official talking points about the conflict.</p>



<p>It left me wondering if I was misremembering the war, or if there was an actual coordinated effort to rewrite the past.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We tend to think of rewriting history as reinterpreting distant events, reworking details buried in time to fit a particular cultural or political moment. But what does it mean to reshape the memory of a war that nearly every Georgian remembers?</p>



<p>I set out to answer two questions: What really led to the 2008 war? And how deeply has Georgian Dream’s version influenced the national memory? I spoke to former government officials, international experts, and, most importantly, the people living along the occupation line – those still living with the war’s consequences day in and day out.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full"><img src="https://www.codastory.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/wires.png" alt="" class="wp-image-57988"/></figure>



<p class="has-drop-cap">My first stop was Kirbali, a village notorious for being a focal point of Russia’s borderization policy, including the kidnapping of residents. Here, the occupation line is mostly invisible, there is no barbed wire, fence, or&nbsp; natural boundary, it’s only marked by occasional signs, making it largely impossible to know where the line is actually located.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is deliberate. It sets up&nbsp; Russia’s so-called “kidnapping” tactic—with Georgian citizens allegedly <a href="https://www.coalitionfortheicc.org/news/20190906/civil-society-joint-statement-on-georgia">snatched</a> from their land to sow fear among the population and pressure whole communities into abandoning their homes, clearing the way for borderization.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-full is-resized"><img src="https://www.codastory.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/kirbali-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-58029" style="width:447px;height:auto"/></figure>



<p>In a village as small as Kirbali, outsiders don’t go unnoticed. As soon as I arrived, the police flagged my car. They asked about the purpose of my visit and insisted that a patrol vehicle accompany me wherever I went.</p>



<p>Authorities knew whom I spoke to and which homes I entered.</p>



<p>I started by heading to the central square. The first thing you see is a portrait of Tamaz Ginture that appears to float in the sky. He was shot and killed by Russian troops in 2023 while attempting to visit a local church. Right below the picture, people gather to chat and play dominoes or backgammon. But as soon as I mentioned the 2008 war, their openness vanished. Most refused to talk. Two men who were willing to speak simply parroted government propaganda.</p>



<p>After an hour, one man who had initially brushed me off quietly invited me to his home for a coffee.</p>



<p>“Everyone’s afraid to talk,” he told me as soon as we sat down. “You won’t get any answers out there.” His wife nodded in agreement, as she set the table.</p>



<p>He explained why: one of the men I’d spoken to in the square was a Georgian Dream coordinator. No one dares to contradict the party line when he’s around.</p>



<p>These “coordinators” are informal, sometimes semi-formal, representatives of Georgian Dream. They’re local operatives embedded in public institutions who help the party monitor communities, manage voter turnout, and shape opinion. In election season, they mobilize supporters. Outside of it, they track who says what.</p>



<p>The fear they instill is real, especially in rural and tight-knit communities. Speaking out can mean losing government benefits, being fired from a public-sector job, or, in some cases, facing physical threats.</p>



<p>That’s the setup in most villages. But in Kirbali, the constant police surveillance made it even harder to get people to chat, to reveal their thoughts or opinions. A patrol car followed my every step.</p>



<p>So I moved on to Ergneti – the first village Russians troops crossed when they entered undisputed Georgian territory. It’s also where a river overlaps with the occupation line, meaning fewer kidnappings and less police presence.</p>



<p>It gave me a little more space to listen and for others to speak.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">Around much of the world, the 2008 Russo-Georgian war came to be known as the “five day war”, the fighting taking place from August 7 to August 12, when a ceasefire agreement was brokered by the French President Nicolas Sarkozy.</p>



<p>But in Georgia, people don’t often refer to the “five-day war”. Here, the war did not feel like it lasted only five days. All the chaos, death and suffering of war were not contained in just those five days.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-large is-resized"><img src="https://www.codastory.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/NNN-923x1200.png" alt="" class="wp-image-58030" style="width:368px;height:auto"/></figure>



<p>While the term captures the war’s most intense phase, it flattens the reality on the ground. It erases the escalation that preceded August 7, and the devastation that continued after the ceasefire was signed – when Russian and Ossetian forces looted villages, set homes ablaze, and remained on uncontested Georgian territory for many more weeks.</p>



<p>For those living along the occupation line, the idea that the war lasted only five days is absurd. When they speak about the war, their timelines stretch far beyond a single week – and often, far beyond 2008.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We have been living with this war for 35 years now,” Nadika told me as she showed me the occupation line from her window. “Many first heard about guns being fired in 2008 and the first bomb was a shock. But that was nothing new for us,” she added.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignleft size-full is-resized"><img src="https://www.codastory.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_7524.png" alt="" class="wp-image-58061" style="width:389px;height:auto"/></figure>



<p>Nadika, now in her 50s, has spent her entire life in Ergneti, a village that borders Tskhinvali, the de facto South Ossetian capital. Today, Ergneti is eerily quiet. The closer you get to the occupation line, the more houses you see standing empty. Nadika and Maguli live in the strip closest to the line, their families among the few who remain. Ergneti has no shops or pharmacies, and many residents commute to Tbilisi for work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Only one bus runs twice a day, covering several villages on its way. It often starts full, with people sitting on makeshift chairs, but few passengers make it all the way to Ergenti where the last stop is right in front of the Georgian patrol post. Before the 2008 war, Ergneti was not a ghost town even though for Nadika, Maguli and other residents, gunfire and shelling were so frequent they became part of the day’s sounds, like a rooster crowing in the morning. It’s why Nadika doesn’t talk of 2008 alone, when she talks about the war. She traces it back to the Soviet Union’s collapse and the wave of violence that followed in its wake, culminating in the 1991 war between Georgian government forces and Russian-backed South Ossetian separatists.</p>



<p>Others trace it back even further.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the one bus that takes you to Ergneti, I met Tamara Kviginadze, a soft-spoken philologist in her 60s who grew up in Tskhinvali. She travels to Ergneti almost every week to visit the graves of her parents who wanted to be buried close to their hometown, Tskhinvali.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For her, the war began in the beginning of the 19th century, when the Russian Empire first arrived in Georgia.</p>



<p>By the end of the 18th century, Georgia was a fractured land. In the west, minor kingdoms operated under heavy Ottoman influence. In the east, King Erekle II had recently managed to shake off Persian rule, taking advantage of a succession crisis in the Qajar dynasty. But he knew the peace wouldn’t last. With another Persian invasion looming, Erekle had few options. He sent appeals to Europe. No one answered. The only door left open was to the north. Russia, then expanding southward, presented itself as a Christian ally and protector.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, in 1783, Erekle II signed an agreement with Russia. Moscow promised to safeguard Georgia’s independence and territory. Georgia, in return, renounced any allegiance to Persia or the Ottoman Empire.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignright size-large is-resized"><img src="https://www.codastory.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Erekle2-825x1200.png" alt="" class="wp-image-57942" style="width:489px;height:auto"/></figure>



<p>On paper, the deal seemed beneficial to Georgia but when the Persian army came marching, there were no Russian troops in sight. And when the smoke cleared, Russia came, not to help, but to annex. By 1801, Georgia was no longer sovereign.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>For the next two centuries, Georgia only managed to gain independence only once: in 1918, after the Russian Empire crumbled. Its independence lasted just three years.</p>



<p>That year, 1918, also marked the first outbreak of violent clashes between the Georgian army and separatists formations in the regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After the February Revolution in Petrograd in 1917, which precipitated the end of the Romanovs, Ossetians and Abkhazians set up National Councils which advocated for the creation of organs of self-rule in Abkhazia and&nbsp; Ossetian-inhabited areas. The councils in both regions, dominated by Bolshevik ideology, became deeply intertwined with Bolshevik forces inside Soviet Russia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For the Georgian authorities, these uprisings were viewed not as a fight for autonomy, but as a Soviet-backed attempt to destabilize the fragile new republic. The Georgian army eventually crushed the rebellion, but the violence left deep scars, fueling a legacy of mistrust and ethnic tension. The victory was also short-lived. In 1921, the Red Army invaded from the north and the country was forcibly absorbed into the newly forming Soviet Union. The promise of independence was snuffed out, replaced by 70 years of authoritarian rule, during which the roots of many future conflicts, including the war in 2008, took hold.</p>



<p>“The empire has one rule,” Tamara told me on the bus. “Divide, indoctrinate, rule. That’s it.”&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full"><img src="https://www.codastory.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Tsiteli_armia_TbilisSi2.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-57946"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Soviet Russia’s 11th Red Army in Tbilisi, 1921. From the Guram Sharadze collection/National Library of Georgia.</figcaption></figure>



<p class="has-drop-cap">After the Soviet Union collapsed, Georgia’s first decade of independence was defined by economic ruin, crumbling institutions, and civil war in the streets of Tbilisi. A newly independent nation was rejecting its former master and looking towards the West for protection.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Abkhazia, separatists emboldened by Moscow started calling for independence. In South Ossetia, the goal was unification with Russia. “By the late ‘80s,” Tamara told me, “you could feel it changing – when it came to politics, we were divided.” She recalls Ossetian militias appearing in Tskhinvali around 1988.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Tbilisi, Zviad Gamsakhurdia, a former Soviet dissident, came to power. As demands for autonomy grew, so did his nationalistic rhetoric. By 1990, in Tskhinvali, ethnic tensions were rising. Tamara’s family now slept with their suitcases packed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“They started marking Georgian houses with a Z – just like in Ukraine now,” she told me as she recalled her encounter with a young Ossetian boy who came to her with a warning: “He told me that he was at the base and overheard a conversation about which Georgian families were in line to be terrorized.” Seal the windows, Molotovs are coming, he said and left.</p>



<p>Soon, South Ossetia declared independence, Gamsakhurdia responded by revoking its autonomy. A year-long war followed. Over 1,000 people lost their lives and tens of thousands were displaced, including Tamara’s family who are still unable to go back to their home.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Abkhazia saw even more devastation. The separatists captured Sukhumi in 1993. The war left 10,000 dead and over 250,000 Georgians ethnically cleansed – one of the largest population displacements in the post-Soviet space.</p>





<p>Just like in 1921, the support for separatist movements came from Russia but this time, it played the roles of both arsonist and firefighter: arming separatists, providing air support, and deploying irregular fighters who would later become a staple in Russia’s foreign wars, all while offering to broker peace.</p>



<p>By the end of 1990s, Georgia ended up with two breakaway regions, and Russian peacekeepers on the ground.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meanwhile in Tbilisi, a political transformation was underway. In 2003, mass protests – known as the Rose Revolution – toppled the old regime and brought Mikheil Saakashvili to power. Young and U.S.-educated, Saakashvili was a reformer with a clear message: Georgia would no longer orbit Moscow. Instead, it would pursue modernization, with EU and NATO membership as the ultimate goal.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.codastory.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-1863295387-1643x1200.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-58023"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Georgia's President Mikhail Saakashvili (C) during the rally in Batumi,18 March 2004.

<p>Russia hit back. It banned key Georgian exports, cut gas supplies, and illegally deported thousands of Georgian migrant workers. On the ground, it expanded support for the separatist regimes, quietly increased its military presence under the cover of peacekeeping and issued Russian passports to their populations, a move that would later enable Moscow to claim protection of Russian citizens as a pretext to invade Georgia.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">In 2007, Vladimir Putin stood before an audience of Western leaders in Munich and delivered what many thought was a theatrical outburst. He railed against U.S. hegemony, accused NATO of encroachment, and warned that a unipolar world was unacceptable. The speech was blunt – but few in the West took it seriously. Instead, it was viewed as a nostalgic rant from a former KGB man still mourning the Soviet collapse.</p>



<p>But the Kremlin wasn’t bluffing. The Munich speech was a statement of intent. And the West’s underestimation turned out to be a strategic miscalculation.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.codastory.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-73282484-1800x1037.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-58026"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Russian President Vladimir Putin during the 2007 speech in Munich.

<p>By mid-2008, Russia was in a position of unusual strength. Oil prices were soaring. European states – particularly Germany, France, and Italy – were deeply entangled in energy deals with Gazprom.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Washington, George W. Bush’s presidency was limping to an end. His foreign policy legacy – Iraq, Afghanistan – had sapped both credibility and political capital. Barack Obama, still a candidate, was already talking about a “reset” with Russia. The West wasn’t ready for a confrontation, and Moscow knew it.</p>



<p>While the Baltic states and some Eastern Europeans were sounding alarms about Russian aggression, Western Europe remained fixated on maintaining business as usual.</p>



<p>Russia, though imperfect, was still seen as a partner – a regional power with whom the West could reason, negotiate, and, when needed, do business. Against that backdrop, Georgia’s young, Westward-looking president was easier to caricature. Saakashvili’s warnings of further Russian aggression were brushed off as alarmism.</p>



<p>So when war broke out in August 2008, that pre-existing perception – a stable, reactive Russia versus a hot-headed, unpredictable Georgia – shaped how the story was told. Western media fixated on the question of who fired the first shot, not who had laid the groundwork or moved troops into another sovereign country. And Western leaders, unwilling to jeopardize fragile ties with Moscow, leaned into the narrative that Georgia bore at least partial blame.</p>



<p>This mindset shaped the “Tagliavini Report”, the EU’s official post-mortem on the war written by a team led by Swiss diplomat Heidi Tagliavini and published in September 2009, just over a year after the war. While the <a href="http://www.echr.coe.int/documents/d/echr/hudoc_38263_08_Annexes_eng">document</a> acknowledged years of escalating provocations, Russia’s disproportionate use of force, and the presence of the Russian army in Georgia&nbsp; prior to August 8, it also placed significant responsibility on Tbilisi for launching the first full-scale military assault on Tskhinvali. It was a legal framing that ignored the broader political climate – in which Russia had been undermining Georgian sovereignty through proxy forces, passportization, and military buildup for years.</p>



<p>The result was a narrative that satisfied diplomatic caution: both sides bore blame, so the West wouldn’t have to choose. And by the time Russian troops settled into new military bases deep in Georgia’s breakaway regions, the world had already moved on. Obama went on to push the ‘reset’ button, while EU countries continued selling military equipment to Russia, some of which would later appear on the frontlines in Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Subsequent reporting and analysis would complicate that picture with Western analysts later publishing satellite images that appeared to support Georgia’s timeline, showing large Russian convoys already moving through the South Ossetian mountains on August 7. But first impressions are hard to shake. For many outside observers, the image of Georgia shelling a breakaway capital – regardless of the context – became the war’s defining moment. That framing, cemented in early news coverage and echoed by the Tagliavini report, continued to shape international opinion.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">The international view of the 2008 war shifted only after 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea and backed separatists in eastern Ukraine. Suddenly, Georgia was seen less as an isolated case and more as a test run. Yet even this re-examination was half-hearted. It wasn’t until Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 that the implications of Russia’s actions in 2008 became impossible to soft pedal.</p>



<p>Governments that had once blamed both sides for the Georgia war now spoke of “patterns”. Think tanks drew direct lines from the Roki Tunnel to the Donbas. Many experts in the West now saw 2008 as the opening move in a long campaign of revanchist warfare. But while the international community was re-contextualizing 2008 as the beginning of something larger, Georgia’s own government was trying to prove otherwise. Georgian Dream has organized what they call a “Nuremberg trial” in Georgia that will show that it was the previous government, in other words the Georgian state, which bears primary responsibility for starting the war.</p>



<p>For hours on live TV, retired generals and ex-officials have been grilled on minute details, on exact locations, timelines, on who participated in what meeting. Each session was packed with people spewing dense detail about military plans and discussion inside the corridors of Georgian power at the time. The questions being asked appeared laced with accusation and insinuation. The aim seemed to be to lay the blame squarely on Saakashvili and his allies, while also absolving the military of guilt.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Several politicians who refused to attend the hearings have been <a href="https://civil.ge/archives/688903">arrested</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">For now, it seems the government's efforts are already paying off. On what is now the 17th anniversary of the war, people remember those five days in starkly different ways, shaped not just by their lived experience but by competing narratives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nadika remembers the shelling and the chaos. But her memories are laced with suspicion. She’s come to believe that the war was staged; part of a plot by Saakashvili’s government. “They were bought off,” she says. “From the very first day, they were on TV boasting about how the army took this village or that one.” She thinks Georgia provoked Russia, maybe even invited the invasion. “Why did the commanders run?” she asks me, citing a conspiracy theory that is not rooted in any evidence. More recently, she’s begun echoing another popular Georgian Dream line: that the West once again tried to pull Georgia into another war in Ukraine. “They were pushing for a second front,” she says. “Even Ukrainians were calling on us to join.”</p>



<p>But not everyone in Ergneti buys into that version. Maguli, who gave birth during the bombardment, says she has no loyalty to Saakashvili, but she remembers who shelled her town. “I’m not a supporter of this government or the previous one,” she says. “But I had to jump out of a hospital window with my hours-old baby while the town was being shelled. And I’m still the one to blame?” She wants peace but not historical revision. “I can’t go along with people rewriting history,”she tells me, adding that she’s been trying to bring together historians, researchers, and neighbors to revisit what really happened.</p>



<p>Tamara, meanwhile, outright rejects the notion that Georgia could have started the war. “How can we be the ones to start a war on our own land, while bombs are falling and the [Russian] army is invading?” she asks, incredulous. She remembers, she tells me, what she saw, what she witnessed happen – bombs going off and Russian soldiers crossing into Georgia on August 7.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Three women. Three versions of the same war. Three memories shaped by where they lived, what they lost, and increasingly what they’ve been told happened. Their stories show how even recent history can splinter under the weight of competing truths. Their stories show how collective memory can be pulled in competing directions by politics, fear, and the calculated reconstruction of events long after the bombs stop falling.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video alignwide"><video autoplay loop muted poster="https://www.codastory.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/bruno1_mp4_avc_240p.original.jpg" src="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/1AuB59o9/bruno1.mp4" playsinline></video></figure>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Authoritarian leaders have long understood the power of history. It is by recasting the past that authoritarians reinforce their hold on the present and even the future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the details of stories differ, the playbook is often the same: simplify the past, claim things were once great until the bad people ruined it. For Georgian Dream, it is the previous government that brought the 2008 war with Russia to Georgia. But its narrative has the effect of blaming Georgia as a whole for poking the bear.</p>



<p>I spoke to the American historian, Timothy Snyder, who has long <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXR9PByA9SY">warned</a> of the authoritarian tenor and tone of Donald Trump’s presidency. Referring to Georgian Dream’s version of the 2008 war, he said: “The problem with the story is that Georgia is not really the subject. The story is about how Russia is innocent and how poor Russia was provoked by Georgia. This is not a native authoritarian phenomenon, but a foreign one being reproduced as a native story.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>So how does this story benefit Georgian Dream? The most common explanation is that they are using their version of the past to discredit local rivals and prolong their rule. If Russia is rational and only violent when provoked, then Saakashvili’s government appears irrational, reckless, and responsible for the war. And remember, in Georgian Dream’s political rhetoric, all opposition to it is affiliated with Saakashvili.&nbsp;</p>





<p>But it’s hard to believe that this is the entirety of Georgian Dream’s intent. To me, the larger goal seems to be dismantling anti-Russia sentiment in Georgia – a goal that’s reflected in other attempts at rewriting history.</p>



<p>Take, for example, the ruling party’s adoption of a new political icon: the 18th-century king, Erekle II who signed a treaty with Russia that effectively led to Georgia’s subjugation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since 2022, Erekle’s name has been intrinsic to Georgian Dream’s slogans. And a statue of Erekle II is set to rise on the Kakheti Highway, near the headquarters of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Erekle is being celebrated as a symbol of pragmatism, a savior of Georgian Christianity, and proof that alignment with Moscow is Georgia’s historic path. But Georgian Dram ignores Erekle’s pro-European efforts, until he felt he had little choice but to turn to Russia for protection from Persia, and Russia’s betrayal of that very treaty.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another example is the rewriting of the April 9 tragedy in 1989, when Soviet troops violently suppressed a peaceful Georgian protest, killing 21 people. This year, the government’s official <a href="https://www.radiotavisupleba.ge/a/%E1%83%9D%E1%83%AA%E1%83%9C%E1%83%94%E1%83%91%E1%83%98%E1%83%A1-%E1%83%9E%E1%83%90%E1%83%A0%E1%83%90%E1%83%9A%E1%83%94%E1%83%9A%E1%83%94%E1%83%91%E1%83%98-%E1%83%93%E1%83%98%E1%83%9E-%E1%83%A1%E1%83%A2%E1%83%94%E1%83%98%E1%83%A2%E1%83%97%E1%83%90%E1%83%9C-%E1%83%93%E1%83%90-%E1%83%90%E1%83%A0%E1%83%AA%E1%83%94%E1%83%A0%E1%83%97%E1%83%98-%E1%83%A1%E1%83%98%E1%83%A2%E1%83%A7%E1%83%95%E1%83%90-%E1%83%A0%E1%83%A3%E1%83%A1%E1%83%94%E1%83%97%E1%83%96%E1%83%94/33378742.html">statement</a> replaced the word “Russia” with “foreign power,” the term officials often use for the West. Putin’s Russia, the argument seems to be, must not be conflated with the Soviet Union.</p>



<p>But why might some Georgians go along with the idea that we started the war?</p>



<p>Because memory is fragile. Every time we recall the past, we reshape it, filter it through what we’ve heard, what we’ve lost, and what we choose to believe. Repeated messages from those in power can overwrite what we thought we knew. Even if it’s victim-blaming on a national scale. “No one, no serious future historian is ever going to contest that Russia invaded Georgia, or Ukraine,” Snyder told me. “But if you can make it hard for people to say basic truths, because you have another big narrative in the mix, then you make it hard for people to recognize one another.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tamara, whom I met on the bus to Ergneti, said something about this collapse of shared reality that continues to haunt me: “This is truly the feeling I have, that I’m walking around looking for a homeland inside my homeland. I need help because I feel lost.”</p>

<p>There are now several books about the 2007-8 financial crisis, the best of which, in my opinion, is Adam Tooze’s ‘Crashed’. But the one that everyone remembers is Michael Lewis’s ‘The Big Short’, later made into a movie starring Christian Bale, Ryan Gosling, Steve Carell and Brad Pitt. Its narrative of misfits spotting the mistake everyone else was making is pleasing and elegant, so it’s easy to see why it’s so popular.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sadly, however, it’s completely wrong: bankers didn’t sell insanely risky financial instruments because they misunderstood them, but because the trade was profitable, and they didn’t care if they might blow up the world.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And this brings me to some recent headlines in the FT – “Companies <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/50f98757-3823-4cd2-9adf-738f9e41b546">load up</a> on niche crypto tokens to boost share prices” and “Crypto lenders <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c531a2bc-d258-431b-855c-2a6aaf230661">dial up</a> risk with ‘microfinance on steroids’” – which have very strong pre-2007 energy. Anyone with a brain knows this will end up in disaster, but folks with money want to keep dancing while the music plays, particularly as the United States has cranked up the volume.</p>



<p>“When President Trump took office in January, he promised to make America the ‘crypto capital of the world’. Today, the President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets is releasing a report that provides a roadmap to make that promise a reality,” <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/07/fact-sheet-the-presidents-working-group-on-digital-asset-markets-releases-recommendations-to-strengthen-american-leadership-in-digital-financial-technology/">pledged</a> the White House last week in a new strategy document</p>



<p>Perhaps the idiocy of this strategy can be best understood by pointing out its reference to “<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/operation-chokepoint-20-crypto-debanking-conspiracy/">Operation Choke Point 2.0</a>”, a confected scandal named after another confected scandal. The reason banks denied services to crypto companies is because cryptocurrencies are frequently used to enable, commit and spread financial crime, so it was an entirely sensible decision. And yet here’s the White House repeating the branding dreamt up by lobbyists to claim it was some kind of campaign against free speech. Crypto, of course, being the answer to the alleged erosion of freedoms.</p>



<p>The crypto boom may in fact be worse than the mortgage-backed feeding frenzy that preceded 2007-8, because the technology is not just setting us up for a new crash but freeing civilisation’s enemies from the few checks upon them.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>BOOSTING FRAUD WITH BLOCKCHAIN</strong></p>



<p>Back in May, FinCEN <a href="https://www.fincen.gov/news/news-releases/fincen-finds-cambodia-based-huione-group-be-primary-money-laundering-concern">designated</a> Cambodia’s Huione group as being of “Primary Money Laundering Concern”, to reflect its role as the <a href="https://www.elliptic.co/blog/cyber-scam-marketplace">epicentre</a> of fraud in Southeast Asia. Once upon a time, a designation like that was enough to kill a dirty bank (such as Latvia’s <a href="https://www.fincen.gov/news/news-releases/fincen-names-ablv-bank-latvia-institution-primary-money-laundering-concern-and">ABLV</a>). But for a marketplace that lives on Telegram and trades on the blockchain, it appears to make little or no difference. “Transaction data shows no meaningful decline. In fact, our data shows continued or even increased activity,” <a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/huione-guarantee-still-active-despite-shutdown/">concluded</a> Chainalysis about Huione’s fortunes.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the rouble-denominated stablecoin <a href="https://www.elliptic.co/blog/the-rise-of-a7a5-the-ruble-stablecoin-now-transfers-1-billion-per-day?utm_content=340482965&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=linkedin&amp;hss_channel=lcp-5027267">A7A5</a> is transferring more than a billion dollars’ worth of value a day, in what is becoming a magnificently successful sanctions evasion scheme that dodges any possible controls. And that’s before we come onto the “coin swap services” that allow criminals to move value around without encountering any responsible nodes in the crypto system at all.</p>



<p>“A sizable proportion of the $3.6 billion in illicit and high-risk funds flowing through coin swap services originates from darknet markets, ransomware, credit card fraud, hacks, Russian military fundraisers operating in Ukraine, and online gambling. A significant proportion also relates to sanctioned activity, including North Korean money laundering,” <a href="https://www.elliptic.co/blog/unmasking-the-cross-chain-coin-swap-services-laundering-crypto-in-sanctioned-jurisdictions?_gl=1*122ly4o*_up*MQ..*_gs*MQ..&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw4qHEBhCDARIsALYKFNPZ1GhqEqTl3YDrVR4LzkuKnDJmGDEFclWcvs92V6saJVBvMEX2WdgaAr4lEALw_wcB&amp;gbraid=0AAAAADnkGAD_ZK9c-IRaIKCcBcyaeNdqg">notes</a> Elliptic.</p>



<p>When I was in Washington DC a few months ago I had several troubling conversations with crypto people, who were distinguished above all by their complete refusal to accept the existence of any downsides to the spread of blockchain technology, or any benefits to the traditional financial architecture based around banks it would replace. I am, as anyone who has read my books will know, no fan of banks but governments are really going to miss the ability to monitor, control and block the movement of money when it’s gone.</p>



<p><strong>SANCTIONS OVERREACH</strong></p>



<p>Of course, the uneasy secret underlying most anti-money laundering policy is the amount of discretion it gives governments to poke around in our private lives, and how little right we have to appeal against it (this is what the original <a href="https://www.theregreview.org/2024/03/07/englebert-the-myth-of-operation-choke-point/">Operation Choke Point</a>,, and the frustration around it, was about). We are therefore rather dependent on politicians not abusing these powers for their own ends. Which is unfortunate in the circumstances.</p>



<p>“Alexandre de Moraes has taken it upon himself to be judge and jury in an unlawful witch hunt against U.S. and Brazilian citizens and companies,” said&nbsp;Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent, in a <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sb0211">statement</a> announcing sanctions against the Brazilian judge who’s investigating former President Jair Bolsonaro on charges of attempting a coup.</p>



<p>There is a grotesque irony in the fact that these misguided sanctions are being enacted using the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jul/06/who-was-sergei-magnitsky-and-how-did-uk-sanctions-come-about">Sergei Magnitsky</a> Act, which is <a href="https://www.state.gov/global-magnitsky-act/">intended</a> to punish corruption and human rights abuses. Perhaps the lesson we need to learn is that there needs to be better oversight of all the powers we give to our governments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Considering the decades-long disastrous consequences caused by well-intentioned but badly-designed anti-money-laundering policies – not least the wholesale <a href="https://www.muslimcharitiesforum.org.uk/resources/the-landscape-of-debanking-within-muslim-charities-and-its-impact-on-charitable-activities/">exclusion</a> of Muslim charities from the banking system – this could end up being a good thing. Just looking for a silver lining here.</p>



<p><strong>A DYSTOPIC DREAM DIES?</strong></p>



<p>I was listening to ‘In the Studio’, the excellent BBC podcast, when what should pop up but an<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/w3ct5tm5"> episode</a> on Neom, the ridiculous linear city concept apparently inspired by the 1997 Bruce Willis movie ‘The Fifth Element’, though without the punkish charm. In case you haven’t heard of Neom, it’s “an experiment in urban living”, which will extend two parallel lines of mirrored skyscrapers across 100 miles of Saudi desert, an idea so hellish that even <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12331767-high-rise">JG Ballard</a> would surely reject it out of hand.</p>



<p>Anyway, it appears the government in Riyadh has realised that spending a trillion dollars or more on some architectural fever dream might be a bad idea. “They’re finally starting to make financially sound decisions,”&nbsp;a consultant <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/18/saudi-arabias-the-line-at-neom-is-reviewed-as-it-considers-its-megaprojects.html">told</a> CNBC.</p>



<p>I have been slightly obsessed with Neom for a while, and my (least) favourite bit is always when the architects wax lyrical about Mohamed bin Salman – the delicacy of his vision, the profundity of his understanding – and then clam up as soon as someone asks whether it’s right for his government to <a href="https://www.ecdhr.org/the-cost-of-opposing-neom-arbitrary-detention-and-unjust-sentences-for-saudi-arabias-al-huwaitat-tribe/">sentence</a> people to death for resisting eviction from their ancestral homes so this horrific new city can be built. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Some terms – such as “virtue signalling” – are irritating and illuminating in equal measure. The insult <a href="https://iaccseries.org/iacc_workshop/ngos-in-exile-how-not-to-become-a-grant-eater/">“grant eater”</a>, which is widely used in the former Soviet Union, is one of them. It is used to describe non-governmental organisations that rely on funding from abroad, specifically from Western countries, and bluntly suggests that they serve foreign interests rather than the local causes that they purport to represent.</p>



<p>This does happen. I have known several NGOs whose primary focus is on Western donors, Western conferences, and publicising themselves to Western audiences. But there’s also a reason why Western-funded organisations are good, in that they allow campaigns for transparency, integrity and democracy to survive in countries where the kind of people rich enough to fund an NGO want the opposite of those things.&nbsp;</p>





<p>Ukraine’s anti-corruption NGOs are regularly accused of being grant eaters by their opponents, but I am delighted that this does not deter them. Nor has it deterred Westerners from supporting Ukrainian calls for the government in Kyiv to backtrack on its foolish, self-defeating and ill-designed<a href="https://antac.org.ua/en/news/how-zelensky-plans-to-destroy-anti-corruption-infrastructure/"> legislation</a> to scrap the independence of anti-corruption agencies.</p>



<p>Now that President Volodymyr Zelensky has <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20250724-zelensky-approves-new-bill-restoring-independence-of-anti-corruption-bodies-after-protests">bowed</a> to this pressure, it is important that Westerners maintain it until he has restored what he removed, and that they keep funding the organisations fighting for an honest future for Ukrainians. Since 2014, Ukrainians have insisted that they are fighting a war on two fronts: one in the East against Russia; and one at home, against corrupt oligarchs. These two fronts cannot be fought in isolation.</p>



<p>“Freedom of speech and pluralism are essential in democracies. Ukraine’s authorities should not engage in nor tolerate retaliation against civic activists who expose alleged corruption and abuses of power,” <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/07/24/anti-corruption-activist-under-pressure-in-ukraine">said</a> Human Rights Watch.</p>



<p>This also applies to Georgia, where the government has been imposing Russia-style restrictions on foreign funding for NGOs, much to the <a href="https://www.coe.int/en/web/commissioner/-/commissioner-is-concerned-about-intrusive-inquiries-into-ngos-that-are-at-odds-with-georgia-s-human-rights-commitments">concern</a> of European institutions.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>CAN CONGRESS CLEAN UP THE ART MARKET?</strong></p>



<p>Considering the White House’s crypto policies amount to the US basically throwing open the doors of the financial system to criminals, crooks and kleptocrats, it seems weird to be pleased about a proposal to partially close one small side-window. But still it’s important to focus on positive news when/if it turns up, so let’s do that.</p>



<p>Six senators, including long-term anti-corruption champion Sheldon Whitehouse, have tabled a bill extending anti-money-laundering provisions to the vast and under-regulated art market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Art should be for art-lovers, not terrorists and criminals,”&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fetterman.senate.gov/fetterman-colleagues-introduce-legislation-to-crack-down-on-money-laundering-and-terror-financing-in-the-art-market/">said</a>&nbsp;Senator John Fetterman.&nbsp;“For too long, loopholes have allowed Russian criminal kingpins to evade sanctions and terrorists like Hezbollah to funnel money through art deals. I’m grateful to Senators Grassley, Whitehouse, McCormick, Kim, and Cassidy for working across the aisle to require art dealers and auction houses to perform basic due diligence.”</p>



<p>Art, antiquities, and other valuable objects are pretty perfectly designed for money laundering. Their value is negotiable, they are easy to transport, can be bought for cash, and change hands in opaque deals brokered by intermediaries skilled in concealing the identities of everyone involved. “For those looking to launder money,” as this article <a href="https://www.artandobject.com/news/how-money-laundering-works-art-world">notes</a>, “it’s difficult to conjure up a more attractive set of circumstances than those.” This is why the Financial Action Task Force has repeatedly <a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/content/dam/fatf-gafi/reports/Money-Laundering-Terrorist-Financing-Art-Antiquities-Market.pdf.coredownload.pdf">warned</a> that the art market, which is worth around <a href="https://www.ubs.com/global/en/our-firm/art/art-market-research.html#:~:text=Global%20art%20sales%20rebounded%20above,an%20estimated%20USD%2065.1%20billion.">$65 billion</a> globally each year, needs better controls.</p>



<p>The European Union’s fifth anti-money-laundering <a href="https://www.ennessglobal.com/insights/blog/impact-5th-eu-anti-money-laundering-directive-art-market">directive</a> (5AMLD) five years ago imposed obligations for everyone involved in buying and selling art to check their customers’ identities, and the origins of their wealth, which brought the British art market – one of the world’s big three, along with China and the United States – under a modicum of control.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last year, the US Treasury <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/2024-National-Money-Laundering-Risk-Assessment.pdf">raised</a> concern that the art market was “susceptible to abuse”, and now the proposed Art Market Integrity Act&nbsp;will hopefully bring the United States into line with other Western countries.</p>



<p>“This important legislation will help the United States go after Russian oligarchs using art to launder money and aid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine,” &nbsp;<a href="https://www.razomforukraine.org/advocacy/">said</a>&nbsp;Mykola Murskyj, Director of Razom Advocacy. “Ukrainian authorities have identified over $1.3 billion worth of art pieces being used by Russian oligarchs to evade U.S. sanctions. The time is right for Congress to crack down,”</p>



<p><strong>MEME COIN BOUNTY HUNTERS</strong></p>



<p>Speaking of cracking down. Congress could do with looking into crypto’s influence on the White House. If there is anyone who thinks I’m being a bit alarmist about the crypto industry’s heavy petting with the U.S. administration, I suggest reading this <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5e399e8c6e9872149fc4a041/t/687519b9ae31363dbdaa8475/1752504761746/craaft-II-bp2-virtual-assets-july-2025.pdf">briefing</a> about how terrorists are using cryptocurrencies to raise funds. On page five, there’s an example of Hamas raising funds in Tether’s USDT on the TRON blockchain in February this year. We know about this thanks to a confiscation <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/media/1394711/dl?inline">request</a> from U.S. authorities, but it wasn’t that long ago when law enforcement agencies would be investigating not just the transaction, but the companies behind it.</p>



<p>On the contrary, Tether’s CEO Paolo Ardoino was in the White House to <a href="https://www.ainvest.com/news/tether-approved-issue-usdt-genius-act-2507/">witness</a> Donald Trump signing the Genius act into law earlier this month, while Justin Sun – founder of TRON – is a <a href="https://dig.watch/updates/justin-sun-makes-30-million-investment-in-wlf">major investor</a> in Trump’s own crypto company World Liberty Financial, and has just rung the bell for TRON to start <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/justin-sun-rings-nasdaq-bell-for-tron-inc/">trading</a> on the Nasdaq.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is head spinning how fast this is all moving.</p>



<p>And finally, if you haven’t yet read Project Brazen’s <a href="https://whalehunting.projectbrazen.com/rich-list-playboy-financier-jho-low-turned-international-fugitive/">spectacular</a> piece of investigative journalism in which they tracked down the fugitive financier Jho Low to an exclusive neighbourhood in Shanghai, then you really should. Brazen co-founders Tom Wright and Bradley Hope have been tracking Jho Low for years, but what’s particularly cool about this latest iteration of their investigation is how they did it: with the <a href="https://x.com/TomWrightAsia/status/1946378818245247485">$JHOLOW meme coin</a>.</p>



<p>“Our unconventional twist is that if a tipster sends us something truly new about Jho – whether a never-before-published picture, a document, a recording, a video, a really tangible lead – - they will be paid a ‘bounty’ in $JHOLOW meme coins,” they <a href="https://whalehunting.projectbrazen.com/the-case-for-jholow-2/">wrote</a> back in March. Since the coins could be converted into real money, this was a genuine bounty, and it helped bring in new information.</p>



<p>Meme coins are <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/en-gb/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-a-memecoin">weird things</a>, gaining or losing value from odd shifts in fashion, culture or online discourse, and there is something extremely exciting about the prospect of mobilising that strange quality for tracking down crooks rather than enabling or enriching them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“A provocative goal of the experiment is to attract Jho Low’s own attention. By turning his story into a live financial game, $JHOLOW might compel Low to engage, even if covertly,” Hope wrote, in his white paper launching the project. “The exploration of investigative meme coins like $JHOLOW prompts a fundamental question: can we redeem the act of speculation by yoking it to the public good of truth-seeking? The jury is still out, but the possibility is tantalising.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In September, the International Criminal Court will conduct a confirmation of charges hearing against warlord Joseph Kony. Leader of the once notorious rebel group Lord’s Resistance Army and the subject of ICC warrants dating back two decades, Kony is still at large, still evading arrest.</p>



<p>Thirteen years ago, a group of American do-gooders tried to do something about this.&nbsp;</p>





<p>The NGO Invisible Children published a 30-minute YouTube video with high hopes. With their film ‘Kony 2012’, they sought to stop the Lord’s Resistance Army, which had kidnapped, killed and brought misery to families across several Central African nations since the late 1980s. The video opens with our blue orb home spinning in outer space as the director reminds us of our place in time. “Right now, there are more people on Facebook than there were on the planet 200 years ago,” he says. “Humanity's greatest desire is to belong and connect, and now, we see each other. We hear each other. We share what we love. And this connection is changing the way the world works.” In other words,&nbsp; the technology of connection will solve this problem.</p>



<p>Despite the uber virality of the film,100 million plus views nearly overnight, Kony remains a free man, though much more infamous, and his victims didn’t get all the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/19/kony-2012-nirvana-missed-chance">help</a> they needed. The campaign seemed to embody slacktivism at its most poisonous: the high hope that you can change the world from your sofa.</p>



<p>“Hope,” Gloria Steinem once wrote, “is a very unruly emotion.” Steinem was writing about US politics in the Nixon era but the observation holds. Hope is at the core of how many of us think about the future. Do we have hope? That’s good. It’s bad if we have the opposite – despair, or even cynicism.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Former CNN international correspondent, Arwa Damon knows this unruly quality of hope firsthand. For years she worked as a journalist in conflict zones. Now she helps kids injured by war through her charity called <a href="https://inara.org/arwa/">INARA</a>. She discussed this work last month at <a href="https://www.zegfest.com/">ZEG Fest</a>, Coda’s annual storytelling festival in Tbilisi. In war, Damon has seen how combatants toy with hope, holding out the possibility of more aid, less fighting only to undermine these visions of a better tomorrow. This way, she says they snuff out resistance. This way they win.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In seeing this, and in surviving her own <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2016/11/14/middleeast/rescuing-arwa-damon-producers-notebook">close calls</a>, Damon told the Zeg attendees, she realized she didn’t need hope to motivate her. “Fuck hope,” she said to surprised laughter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So what motivates her to keep going? “Moral obligation,” she said. After everything she has seen, she simply cannot live with herself if she doesn’t help.&nbsp; She doesn’t need to hope for an end to wars to help those injured by them now. In fact, such a hope might make her job harder because she’d have to deal with the despair when this hope gets dashed, as it will again and again. She can’t stop wars, but she can, and does, help the kids on the front lines.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most of us haven’t crawled through sewers to reach besieged Syrian cities or sat with children in Iraq recovering from <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2016/05/27/health/youssif-burn-recovery-2016">vicious attacks.</a> And most of us don’t spend our days marshalling aid convoys into war zones. But we see those scenes on our phones, in near real time. And many of us feel unsure what to do with that knowledge because most of us would like to do <em>something </em>about these horrors. How do we deal with this complex emotional reality? Especially since, even if we are not in a physical war zone, the information environment is packed with people fighting to control the narratives. In this moment of <a href="https://jskfellows.stanford.edu/noise-is-the-new-censorship-b64b8c50e7e8">information overload</a> and <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2025/02/25/u-s-workers-are-more-worried-than-hopeful-about-future-ai-use-in-the-workplace/">gargantuan </a><a href="https://climatecommunication.yale.edu/visualizations-data/ycom-us/">problems</a>, could clinging onto hope be doing us more harm than good?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Emotion researchers like Dr. Marc Brackett will tell you that instead of thinking of emotions as good or bad, we can think of them as signals about ourselves and the world around us. And we could also think about them as behaviors in the real world. Dr. Brackett, who founded and runs the <a href="https://marcbrackett.com/yale-center-for-emotional-intelligence/">Center for Emotional Intelligence at Yale</a>, said hope involves problem solving and planning. Think about exercising, which you might do because you hope to improve your body.&nbsp;In those cases hope could prove a useful motivator. “The people who only have hope but not a plan only really have despair,” Dr. Brackett explained “because hope doesn't result in an outcome.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.codastory.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GUR_4335-1800x1200.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-57417"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Former CNN correspondent Arwa Damon (R) at the ZEG Fest in Tbilisi this year. She told the audience what motivates her is not hope but moral obligation. Photo: Dato Koridze.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Developing a workout plan seems doable. Developing a plan to capture a warlord or stop kids from suffering in wars is a good deal more complex. The 2010s internet gave us slacktivism and Kony 2012, which seems quaint compared to the 2020s internet with its <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-stop-doomscrolling-psychology-social-media-fomo/">doom scrolling,</a> wars in Ukraine and Gaza and much more misery broadcast in real time. What should we <em>do</em> with this information? With this knowledge?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Small wonder people tune out, or in our journalism jargon, practice <a href="https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/news/people-are-turning-away-news-heres-why-it-may-be-happening">news avoidance</a>. But opting out of news doesn’t even provide a respite. Unless you’ve meticulously pruned your social media ecosystem, the wails of children, the worries about climate change, the looming threats of economic disruption or killer machines, those all can quickly crowd out whatever <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/cuteness-cute-kawaii-power-krigolso-uvic-joshua-dale-japan-1.3984970">dopamine </a>you got from that video of puppy taking its first wobbly steps. But paradoxically, the pursuit of feeling good, might actually be part of the problem of hope.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I took these questions about hope to Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett, an acclaimed psychologist and neuroscientist. She too talked less about our brains and more about our behaviors. The author of, among other things, <a href="https://lisafeldmanbarrett.com/"><em>How Emotions are Made</em></a>, Dr. Barrett noted that we might experience hope in the moment as pleasant or energizing and it helps with creating an emotional regulation narrative. Meaning: we can endure difficulty in the present because we believe tomorrow we will feel better, it will get better. However, Barrett said hope alone as a motivator “might not be as resistant to the slings and arrows of life.” If you assume things will get better, and then they don’t, how do you keep going?&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I think people misunderstand what's happening under the hood when you're feeling miserable,” she added. “Lots of times feel unpleasant not because they're wrong but because they're hard.”</p>



<p>I told Dr. Barrett about Damon’s belief that she keeps going because of moral obligation and she again looked at the emotional through the behavioral. “There is one way to think about moral responsibility as something different than hope,” she said, “but if hope is a discipline and you're doing something to make the parts of the world different you could call it the discipline of hope.” This could be a more durable motivation, she suggested, than one merely chasing a pleasant sensation that tomorrow will be better.&nbsp; “My point is that, if your motivation is to feel good, whatever it is you are doing, your motivation will wane.”</p>





<p>After ‘Kony 2012’ shot to astonishing success, in terms of views, the creators raised tens of millions of dollars but achieved little on the ground – an early lesson in the limits of clicktivism. Once upon a time American do-gooders hoped they’d help Ugandan children simply by making a warlord infamous, now the viralness of<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/08/style/kony-2012-invisible-children.html"> &nbsp;Kony 2012</a> feels like a window into a cringey past, a graveyard of hopes dashed. But maybe we just grew up. Maybe our present time and this information environment full of noise and warring parties asks more of us. Maybe hope has a place but among a whole emotional palate of motivations instead of a central pillar keeping us moving forward. Because let’s be honest: we may never get there. &nbsp;Hope, as the experts told me, doesn’t work without a plan. And, raising hopes, especially grand ones like changing global events from your smartphone, only to have them dashed can actually prompt people to disengage, to despair maybe, or even to embrace cynicism so they don’t have to go through the difficult discipline of hope and potential disappointment. &nbsp;</p>



<p>One day, during the start of the pandemic, when my home doubled as my office, I got a piece of professional advice I’ve held tight. A therapist who works with ER doctors shared with a group of us journalists that when we work on tasks that seem never ending, burnout is more likely. To prevent it, he advised that we right-size the problem. Put down the work from time to time, celebrate our achievements (especially in tough times), develop rituals and build out perspective to nourish us as we keep doing the work.</p>



<p>The pandemic ended but we bear the scars and warily look out at a horizon full of looming troubles, most of them way outside the control of any one of us. Both Dr. Marc Brackett and Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett reminded me: emotions are complex and humans aren’t motivated by just one thing. But no matter what mountain we want to climb we would all do well to adopt this conception of hope as a discipline rather than just a feeling. Because in this environment, there’s always someone on the other side betting we’ll give up in despair.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Why a prominent speaker at a global conference on artificial intelligence was silenced</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I was invited to deliver a keynote speech at the ‘<a href="https://aiforgood.itu.int/summit25/">AI for Good Summit</a>’ this year, and I arrived at the venue with an open mind and hope for change. With a title “<em>AI for social good: the new face of technosolutionism</em>” and an abstract that clearly outlined the need to question what “<em>good</em>” is and the importance of confronting power, it wouldn’t be difficult to guess what my keynote planned to address. I had hoped my invitation to the summit was the beginning of engaging in critical self-reflection for the community.&nbsp;</p>





<p>But this is what happened. Two hours before I was to deliver my keynote, the organisers approached me without prior warning and informed me that they had flagged my talk and it needed substantial altering or that I would have to withdraw myself as speaker. I had submitted the abstract for my talk to the summit over a month before, clearly indicating the kind of topics I planned to cover. I also submitted the slides for my talk a week prior to the event.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thinking that it would be better to deliver some of my message than none, I went through the charade or reviewing my slide deck with them, being told to remove any reference to “Gaza” or “Palestine” or “Israel” and editing the word “genocide” to “war crimes” until only a single slide that called for “No AI for War Crimes” remained. That is where I drew the line. I was then told that&nbsp; even displaying that slide was not acceptable and I had to withdraw, a decision they reversed about 10 minutes later, shortly before I took to the stage.</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">"Why I decided to participate" – On being given a platform to send a message to the people in power.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Looking at this year’s keynote and centre stage speakers, an overwhelming number of them came from industry, including Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon. Out of the 82 centre stage speakers, 37 came from industry, compared to five from academia and only three from civil society organisations. This shows that what “good” means in the "AI for Good" summit is overwhelmingly shaped, defined, and actively curated by the tech industry, which holds a vested interest in societal uptake of AI regardless of any risk or harm.</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">"How AI is exacerbating inequality" – On the content of the keynote.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>“AI for Good”, but good for whom and for what?</strong> Good PR for big tech corporations? Good for laundering accountability? Good for the atrocities the AI industry is aiding and abetting? Good for boosting the very technologies that are widening inequity, destroying the environment, and concentrating power and resources in the hands of few? Good for AI acceleration completely void of any critical thinking about its societal implications? Good for jumping on the next AI trend regardless of its merit, usefulness, or functionality? Good for displaying and promoting commercial products and parading robots?</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">"I did not expect to be censored" – On how such summits can become fig leafs to launder accountability.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Any <em>‘</em>AI for Good’ initiative that serves as a stage that platforms big tech, while censoring anyone that dares to point out the industry’s complacency in enabling and powering genocide and other atrocity crimes is also complicit. For a United Nations Summit whose brand is founded upon doing good, to pressure a Black woman academic to curb her critique of powerful corporations should make it clear that the summit is only good for the industry. And that it is business, not people, that counts.</p>



<p><em>This is a condensed, edited version of a blog Abeba Birhane </em><a href="https://aial.ie/blog/2025-ai-for-good-summit/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email"><em>published</em></a><em> earlier this month. The conference organisers, the International Telecommunication Union, a UN agency, </em><a href="https://genevasolutions.news/science-tech/un-ai-summit-accused-of-censoring-criticism-of-israel-and-big-tech-over-gaza-war"><em>said</em></a><em> “all speakers are welcome to share their personal viewpoints about the role of technology in society” but it did not deny demanding cuts to Birhane’s talk. Birhane told Coda that “no one from the ITU or the Summit has reached out” and “no apologies have been issued so far.”</em><br></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>No one becomes an anti-corruption activist to make money, least of all in Ukraine. When I first met the co-founders of the <a href="https://antac.org.ua/en/">Anti-Corruption Action Center</a> – Vitaliy Shabunin and Daria Kaleniuk – back in 2014, they were already veterans of state persecution, and have become only more experienced in the decade since.</p>



<p>AntAC has pioneered and pushed through many of the reforms that have helped Ukraine to become more transparent and less corrupt, leading to the creation of new courts, new laws, new law enforcement agencies, and much more. And this is why it is so alarming that Shabunin has been arrested and his home searched, on the transparently absurd premise that he was dodging military service, while he was following an order from his superior officers to be seconded to the <a href="https://nazk.gov.ua/en/">National Agency for Corruption Prevention</a>.</p>



<p>“We strongly believe that, in addition to illegal persecution, these searches are an attempt by the authorities to obtain information about the Anti-Corruption Action Centre’s activities,” <a href="https://antac.org.ua/en/news/notice-of-suspicion-and-following-searches-of-vitaliy-shabunin-are-an-arbitrary-political-retaliation/">said</a> the AntAC. “The goal is simple – to undermine our activities aimed at exposing government corruption.”</p>



<p>It is easy to condemn corruption by your opponents, but sadly easy to excuse it in your friends, particularly in wartime. AntAC’s consistent refusal to go easy on anyone – for example, over the government’s recent <a href="https://antac.org.ua/en/news/the-zelenskyy-government-illegally-and-in-violation-of-international-obligations-failed-to-appoint-the-winner-of-the-competition-for-the-economic-security-bureau-of-ukraine-esbu-director/">refusal</a> to follow the law over the leadership of the Economic Security Bureau of Ukraine – has won it many enemies, but even its critics <a href="https://www.facebook.com/kostiantyn.korsun/posts/pfbid0EkW8jDDfCteZa13mA6pKHaZoMSYreRbRFiTov2NG223bcWD9n8aEuM1hHCpce2cWl">recognise</a> how central it has been to Ukraine’s democratic development.</p>



<p>“The actions of the pre-trial investigation bodies can be considered either as complete incompetence of officials and unsuitability for their positions, or as a deliberate attack aimed at putting pressure on Vitaliy Shabunin, who continued to criticise the work of state bodies while serving in the military,” <a href="https://zmina.ua/en/statements-en/25918/">said</a> 90 Ukrainian NGOs in a joint statement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Western foreign officials need to raise Shabunin’s case with their Ukrainian counterparts and continue raising it until this case is dropped. If Ukraine wants to keep receiving support as a democracy fighting a dictatorship, it needs to keep acting like a democracy, and that means its leaders being willing to hear things they don’t want to hear.</p>



<p><strong>THE U.S., A CRYPTO-POWERED TAX HAVEN?</strong></p>



<p>So the European Union’s Anti-Money Laundering Authority is up and running, and one of its first acts has been to warn about the <a href="https://www.amla.europa.eu/resources/news-articles/amla-expects-high-standards-against-financial-crime-crypto-sector_en">risk</a> posted by cryptocurrencies in its 2025 <a href="https://www.amla.europa.eu/document/download/b78bee2f-16b9-4742-a3a1-23e7aad394ab_en?filename=AMLA_Work_Programme_July%202025_0.pdf">work programme</a>. Bruna Szego, AMLA’s chair, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/84a4d927-3597-4c51-b8c9-86215f682eda">added</a> that national regulators need to regulate crypto companies as stringently as they do anything else, and that big crypto companies were likely to be among the 40 institutions that AMLA will directly supervise, along with the continent’s largest banks.</p>



<p>The view from the UK is similar. “The risk of money laundering through cryptoassets has increased significantly since 2020 with cryptoassets increasingly appearing in money laundering intelligence over this period. Cryptoassets are increasingly used for laundering all forms of proceeds of crime,” <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/6877be59760bf6cedaf5bd4f/National_Risk_Assessment_of_Money_Laundering_and_Terrorist_Financing_2025_FINAL.pdf">states</a> the country’s newly-published money laundering risk assessment. “The international nature of the blockchain and cryptoasset transactions present unique difficulties in conducting effective enforcement against criminal actors.”</p>



<p>For anyone with a passing acquaintance with money laundering, all of this is completely non-contentious. However, it is hard to square this caution with what’s happening in the United States. Trump’s own crypto company is <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/07/16/trump-linked-wlfi-token-clears-vote-to-become-tradable">expanding</a> its business, U.S. regulators are now cool with retirement accounts <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/e08b00b1-4bfa-4351-be23-b0e3b02294de">holding crypto</a>, and yet another big crypto firm is looking to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/e0a0667c-dd4d-48cd-852a-fe616f4860fc">sell</a> shares on the stock exchange. The technology’s boosters are feeling confident, and presenting blockchain as central to <a href="https://digitalchamber.org/national-security-report/">national security</a>.</p>



<p>I see cryptocurrencies as near perfect tools for criminals and tycoons to escape the rules democracies put in place to prevent them from owning everything and bribing everyone. But I can also appreciate the artistry of the efforts of the Digital Chamber to boost its members’ business interests by arguing that they’re for the good of the United States and therefore for the good of humanity (for are those two causes not one and the same?).</p>



<p>“It is TDC’s position that blockchain technology supports global economic freedom by empowering those who resist tyranny around the world,” said the Chamber, one of the biggest crypto lobbyists in Washington, DC.</p>



<p>I don’t know what’s worse: that people say this stuff without believing it, or that they actually believe it. Being able to move money in secret may theoretically empower everyone, but in reality it disproportionately empowers already rich people. The U.S. is turning itself into a blockchain-powered tax haven at any incredible rate. Cartels, kleptocrats, oligarchs, spies, plutocrats, these are the real long-term beneficiaries from cryptocurrencies, and if we don’t realise that soon then the rest of us will pay a heavy price for Washington’s capitulation to their lobbyists.</p>



<p><strong>THE U.K., TWO STEPS FORWARD, ONE STEP BACK</strong></p>



<p>Britain, meanwhile, continues its inch-by-inch progress towards a less dirty financial system. It has<a href="https://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/11-500-uk-companies-struck-off-companies-house-register-after-crackdown"> dissolved</a> 11,500 companies that did not abide by newer, more stringent rules around transparency, closed three company formation agents, and barred several people from working in corporate formation again. For those of us used to how <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/19/offshore-central-london-curious-case-29-harley-street">appallingly lax</a> things used to be, this is all rather good to see, if <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/greybrow53_thousands-of-uk-companies-have-been-removed-activity-7351288618931429379-jxe7?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAYMLHIBLdDSMghMVR1zAntZyFys_HmjnC0">hard to believe</a> (they do, after all, have previous when it comes to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/22/the-sunday-essay-britain-headquarters-of-fraud">boasting</a> about things they shouldn’t be proud of).</p>





<p>The government is planning a summit on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/the-foreign-secretarys-mansion-house-speech-2025">countering</a> illicit finance which, coupled with a surprisingly <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/appgonacrt.bsky.social/post/3lu5yb5tylk2h">good-looking</a> series of <a href="http://www.gov.uk/government/publications/restoring-trust-in-our-democracy-our-strategy-for-modern-and-secure-elections/restoring-trust-in-our-democracy-our-strategy-for-modern-and-secure-elections">proposals</a> for getting dark money out of politics, feels weirdly hopeful for a country with a tendency to err on the side of letting dirty cash go wherever it likes. I anticipate that counterbalancing bad news will be along next week.</p>



<p>Still, while I’m being optimistic, I’ll give a shout out to <a href="https://joffetrust.org/what-we-do/latimer-network/">The Latimer Network</a>, which brings together experts and practitioners in countering illicit finance from the U.K. and beyond, with the aim of improving how that is done. One of its particular focuses is on trying to think of a better way of identifying money laundering than the current workhorse: the Suspicious Activity Report (SAR).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tens of millions of SARs are filed globally each year, supposedly to alert the authorities to transactions that look dodgy. That is far too many to read, and most of them are valueless anyway, and it would be great to come up with a better way of monitoring transactions, so that criminals are excluded from the financial system. And don’t tell me it’s blockchain.</p>



<p>However, if you’d like an insight into some of the problems facing the British government, here’s a <a href="https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/world/environment-news/70454/water-privatisation-river-sea-pollution">piece</a> I wrote on the absolute disaster that is the national water system. You wouldn’t have thought you could mess up the water supply in a country where it rains so much, and yet, here we are.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The numbers are staggering: Meta is <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/mark-zuckerberg-meta-offer-top-ai-talent-300-million/">offering</a> AI researchers total compensation packages of up to $300 million over four years, with individual deals like former Apple executive Ruoming Pang's <a href="https://www.ainvest.com/news/meta-offers-300-million-ai-talent-2507/">$200 million package</a> making headlines across Silicon Valley. Meanwhile, OpenAI just <a href="https://www.channelinsider.com/news-and-trends/us/open-ai-funding-round-march-2025/">raised</a> $40 billion, with the company valued at $300, reportedly the largest private tech funding round in history.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But beneath these eye-watering dollar figures lies a profound transformation: Silicon Valley’s elite have evolved from eager innovators into architects of a new world order, reshaping society with their unprecedented power. This shift is not just about money or technology, it marks a fundamental change in how power is conceived and exercised.&nbsp;</p>





<p>We often talk about technology as if it exists in a silo, separate from politics or culture. But those boundaries are rapidly dissolving. Technology is no longer just a sector or a set of tools; it is reshaping everything, weaving itself into the very fabric of society and power. The tech elite are no longer content with tech innovation alone, they are crafting a new social and political reality, wielding influence that extends far beyond the digital realm.</p>



<p>To break out of these siloed debates, at the end of June we convened a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DLUwFZ9MLrm/">virtual conversation</a> with four remarkable minds: Christopher Wylie (the Cambridge Analytica whistleblower and host of our <a href="https://www.audible.com/pd/Captured-Audiobook/B0DZJ5W4Y7?qid=1743678504&amp;sr=1-1&amp;ref_pageloadid=not_applicable&amp;pf_rd_p=83218cca-c308-412f-bfcf-90198b687a2f&amp;pf_rd_r=E9Q9MZKWCN2NBSBC3PB0&amp;plink=tXvuPW1hHaatATEj&amp;pageLoadId=J06yHclGbh1Idv9o&amp;creativeId=0d6f6720-f41c-457e-a42b-8c8dceb62f2c&amp;ref=a_search_c3_lProduct_1_1">Captured podcast</a>), pioneering technologist Judy Estrin, filmmaker and digital rights advocate Justine Bateman, and philosopher Shannon Vallor. Our goal: to explore how Silicon Valley’s culture of innovation has morphed into a belief system, one that’s migrated from the tech fringe to the center of our collective imagination, reimagining what it means to be human.</p>



<p>The conversation began with a story from <a href="https://x.com/chrisinsilico?lang=en">Chris Wylie</a> that perfectly captured the mood of our times. While recording the Captured podcast, he found himself stranded in flooded Dubai, missing a journalism conference in Italy. Instead, he ended up at a party thrown by tech billionaires, a gathering that, as he described in a voice note he sent us from the bathroom, felt like a dispatch from the new center of power:</p>



<p>“People here are talking about longevity, how to live forever. But also prepping—how to prepare for when society gets completely undermined.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CS1Xs_z1rFk
</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Listen to Chris Wylie’s secret voice message from a Dubai bathroom.</figcaption></figure>



<p>At that party, tech billionaires weren’t debating how to fix democracy or save society. They were plotting how to survive its unraveling. That fleeting moment captured the new reality: while some still debate how to repair the systems we have, others are already plotting their escape, imagining futures where technology is not just a tool, but a lifeboat for the privileged few. It was a reminder that the stakes are no longer abstract or distant: they are unfolding, right now, in rooms most of us will never enter.</p>



<p>Our discussion didn’t linger on the spectacle of that Dubai party for long. Instead, it became a springboard to interrogate the broader shift underway: how Silicon Valley’s narratives, once quirky, fringe, utopian, have become the new <a href="https://www.codastory.com/captured/">center of gravity</a> for global power. What was once the domain of science fiction is now the quiet logic guiding boardrooms, investment strategies, and even military recruitment.</p>



<p>As Wylie&nbsp; put it, “When you start to think about Silicon Valley not simply as a technology industry or a political institution, but one that also emits spiritual ideologies and prophecies about the nature and purpose of humanity, a lot of the weirdness starts to make a lot more sense.”</p>



<p>Judy Estrin, widely known in tech circles as the "<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/richkarlgaard/2017/12/12/mother-of-the-cloud-silicon-valleys-judy-estrin/">mother of the cloud</a>" for her pioneering role in building the foundational infrastructure of the internet, has witnessed this evolution firsthand. Estrin played a crucial part in developing the TCP/IP protocols that underpin digital communication, and later served as CTO of Cisco during the internet’s explosive growth. She’s seen the shift from Steve Jobs’ vision of technology as "a bicycle for the mind" to Marc Andreessen’s declaration that "software is eating the world."&nbsp;</p>





<p>Now, Estrin sounds the alarm: the tech landscape has moved from collaborative innovation to a relentless pursuit of control and dominance. Today’s tech leaders are no longer just innovators, they are crafting a new social architecture that redefines how we live, think, and connect.</p>



<p>What makes this transformation of power particularly insidious is the sense of inevitability that surrounds it. The tech industry has succeeded in creating a narrative where its vision of the future appears unstoppable, leaving the rest of us as passive observers rather than active participants in the shaping of our technological destiny.</p>



<p>Peter Thiel, the billionaire investor and PayPal co-founder, embodies this mindset. In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/LXpc1YiXDoQ">recent interview</a>, Thiel was asked point-blank whether he wanted the human race to endure. He hesitated before answering, “Uh, yes,” then added: “I also would like us to radically solve these problems…” Thiel’s ambivalence towards other human beings and his appetite for radical transformation capture the mood of a class of tech leaders who see the present as something to be escaped, not improved—a mindset that feeds the sense of inevitability and detachment Estrin warns about.</p>



<p>Estrin argues that this is a new form of authoritarianism, where power is reinforced not through force but through what she calls "silence and compliance." The speed and scale of today's AI integration, she says, requires us " to be standing up and paying more attention."&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Judy Estrin: The Danger of Blind Trust in AI.</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://edwebprofiles.ed.ac.uk/profile/shannon-vallor">Shannon Vallor</a>, philosopher and ethicist, widened the lens. She cautioned that the quasi-religious narratives emerging from Silicon Valley—casting AI as either savior or demon—are not simply elite fantasies. Rather, the real risk lies in elevating a technology that, at its core, is designed to mimic us. Large language models, she explained, are “merely broken reflections of ourselves… arranged to create the illusion of presence, of consciousness, of being understood.”</p>



<p>The true danger, Vallor argued, is that these illusions are seeping into the minds of the vulnerable, not just the powerful. She described receiving daily messages from people convinced they are in relationships with sentient AI gods—proof that the mythology surrounding these technologies is already warping reality for those least equipped to resist it.</p>



<p>She underscored that the harms of AI are not distributed equally: “The benefits of technological innovation have gone to the people who are already powerful and well-resourced, while the risks have been pushed onto those that are already suffering from forms of political disempowerment and economic inequality.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vallor’s call was clear: to reclaim agency, we must demystify technology, recognize who is making the choices, and insist that the future of AI is not something that happens to us, but something that we shape together.</p>



<p>As the discussion unfolded, the panelists agreed: the real threat isn’t just technological overreach, but the surrender of human agency. The challenge is not only to question where technology is taking us, but to insist on our right to shape its direction, before the future is decided without us.</p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/justinebateman?lang=en">Justine Bateman</a>, best known for her iconic roles in Hollywood and her outspoken activism for artists’ rights, entered the conversation with the perspective of someone who has navigated both the entertainment and technology industries. Bateman, who holds a computer science degree from UCLA, has become a prominent critic of how AI and tech culture threaten human creativity and agency.</p>



<p>During the discussion, Bateman and Estrin found themselves at odds over how best to respond to the growing influence of AI. Bateman argued that the real threat isn’t AI itself becoming all-powerful, but rather the way society risks passively accepting and even revering technology, allowing it to become a “sacred cow” beyond criticism. She called for open ridicule of exaggerated tech promises, insisting, “No matter what they do about trying to live forever, or try to make their own god stuff, it doesn’t matter. You’re not going to make a god that replaces God. You are not going to live forever. It’s not going to happen.” Bateman also urged people to use their own minds and not “be lazy” by simply accepting the narratives being sold by tech elites.</p>



<p>Estrin pushed back, arguing that telling people to use their minds and not be lazy risks alienating those who might otherwise be open to conversation. Instead, she advocated for nuance, urging that the debate focus on human agency, choice, and the real risks and trade-offs of new technologies, rather than falling into extremes or prescribing a single “right” way to respond.</p>



<p>“If we have a hope of getting people to really listen… we need to figure out how to talk about this in terms of human agency, choice, risks, and trade-offs,” she said. “Because when we go into the , you’re either for it or against it, people tune out, and we’re gonna lose that battle.”</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Justine Bateman and Judy Estrin - Debate Over AI's Future.</figcaption></figure>



<p>At this point, Christopher Wylie offered a strikingly different perspective, responding directly to Bateman’s insistence that tech was “not going to make a god that replaces God.”</p>



<p>“I’m actually a practicing Buddhist, so I don’t necessarily come to religion from a Judeo-Christian perspective,” he said, recounting a conversation with a Buddhist monk about whether uploading a mind to a machine could ever count as reincarnation. Wylie pointed out that humanity has always invested meaning in things that cannot speak back: rocks, stars, and now, perhaps, algorithms. “There are actually valid and deeper, spiritual and religious conversations that we can have about what consciousness actually is if we do end up tapping into it truly,” he said.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGyWGOB0ZEs&amp;ab_channel=CodaStory
</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Christopher Wylie: Buddhism, AI &amp; Reincarnation.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Rather than drawing hard lines between human and machine, sacred and profane, Wylie invited the group to consider the complexity, uncertainty, and humility required as we confront the unknown. He then pivoted to a crucial obstacle in confronting the AI takeover:</p>



<p>“We lack a common vocabulary to even describe what the problems are,” Wylie argued, likening the current moment to the early days of climate change activism, when terms like “greenhouse gases” and “global warming” had to be invented before a movement could take shape. “Without the words to name the crisis, you can’t have a movement around those problems.”<br><br>The danger, he suggested, isn’t just technological, it’s linguistic and cultural. If we can’t articulate what’s being lost, we risk losing it by default.</p>



<p>Finally, Wylie reframed privacy as something far more profound than hiding: “Privacy is your ability to decide how to shape yourself in different situations on your own terms, which is, like, really, really core to your ability to be an individual in society.”<br><br>When we give up that power, we don’t just become more visible to corporations or governments, we surrender the very possibility of self-determination. The conversation, he insisted, must move beyond technical fixes and toward a broader fight for human agency.</p>

</div><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Christopher Wylie: The Real Barrier to an AI Movement Missing Vocabulary.</figcaption></figure>



<p>As we wrapped up, what lingered was not a sense of closure, but a recognition that the future remains radically open—shaped not by the inevitability of technology, but by the choices we make, questions we ask, and movements we are willing to build. Judy Estrin’s call echoed in the final moments: “We need a movement for what we’re for, which is human agency.”<br></p>



<p>This movement, however, should not be against technology itself. As Wylie argued in the closing minutes, “To criticize Silicon Valley, in my view, is to be pro-tech. Because what you're criticizing is exploitation, a power takeover of oligarchs that ultimately will inhibit what technology is there for, which is to help people.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The real challenge is not to declare victory or defeat, but to reclaim the language, the imagination, and the collective will to shape humanity's next chapter.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I’m sure I’m not the only person who secretly likes a one-star review. It’s awful to get one yourself (and I have, several times), but I have to admit that there is a nasty kind of pleasure to be had from reading at length how someone else’s restaurant, film, album or book is awful. So, if you’re that kind of person too, I recommend you <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/735665?journalCode=cj">dive</a> into “How Well Does the Money Laundering Control System Work?”, a spectacularly critical if scrupulously academic article by Mirko Nazzari and Peter Reuter.</p>



<p>At the risk of giving away the punchline: the short answer to the question in the title is “it doesn’t”. Although, there are also additional details about how the anti-money laundering (AML) system acts as a moat around big banks to protect them from competition, while raising the costs of banking for everyone, excluding vulnerable and marginalised people from the financial system altogether, and doing nothing to stop criminals from keeping their wealth. So perhaps the answer is more like “not only does it not work, but it actively makes the problem it’s purporting to solve significantly worse”.</p>





<p>Of many damning examples that Nazzari and Reuter pick out, perhaps the most striking is how the Financial Action Task Force <a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/publications/High-risk-and-other-monitored-jurisdictions/increased-monitoring-february-2025.html">“grey-listed”</a> South Sudan in 2021 for its failure to meet the FATF’s standards, at a time when the country’s very existence was threatened by civil war and humanitarian crisis. The idea that anyone would choose to launder significant amounts of money through a state without any effective government or legal apparatus is absurd, yet the FATF went ahead and imposed limitations on its ability to access banking services anyway, thus further crippling an already fragile economy and worsening a humanitarian catastrophe.</p>



<p>“It is hard for anyone to defend the current system with enthusiasm. Its failure to reduce either the predicate crimes that generate large criminal revenues or the volume of money laundering is uncontested. Even though specific estimates of costs are lacking, no one doubts that those costs are in the hundreds of billions of dollars globally,” Reuter and Nazzari write. “Government claims of success often appear ritualistic and are seldom scrutinized in detail. Yet, for all that, there is hardly any discussion of fundamental reforms in any country.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>I have been, as regular readers will know, writing a book on this precise topic and it is very pleasing that two distinguished researchers have come to exactly the same conclusions that I came to. I have also recently <a href="https://www.economist.com/1843/2025/07/04/how-tether-became-money-launderers-dream-currency">published</a> an article about how the cryptocurrency tether is a dream tool for criminals looking to evade restrictions, and it is just one of many similar financial innovations that are rendering the AML system an ever-deader duck.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>TURNING A BLIND EYE</strong></p>



<p>On one level this is bad, because anything that makes it easier and cheaper for criminals to keep their money is awful. But on another level, if it was already easy and cheap for criminals to keep their money, perhaps the existential threat to the tattered remnants of the AML system that is posed by crypto gives us an opportunity to design a new system that does better. It is after all a very important challenge.</p>



<p>“All elements of our security are supported by our ability to tackle illicit finance – the flows of funds from criminal activity that underpin threats to the U.K. including terrorist networks, serious and organised crime groups, and hostile state actors,” claims the government’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-security-strategy-2025-security-for-the-british-people-in-a-dangerous-world/national-security-strategy-2025-security-for-the-british-people-in-a-dangerous-world-html">brand new</a> national security strategy.</p>



<p>Part of the difficulty of trying to persuade politicians of the urgency of improving the AML system is the sheer volume of jargon involved. But you don’t need acronyms to explain why this matters: money buys power; the more money criminals, terrorists and spies have, the more powerful they will be; powerful criminals, terrorists and spies are bad; so do something about it; the end. Of course, taking on the rich and powerful requires political determination and a belief in democracy, which is a whole different challenge.</p>



<p>“Foreign agents are watching as America’s anti-corruption regime crumbles. They see an extraordinary window of opportunity, and they know they’ll have to act quickly to take full advantage,” writes Casey Michel in <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/07/trump-corruption-foreign-regimes/683487/">this</a> hugely alarming article (there’s something about seeing everything put together in one place). “Foreign regimes are beginning to see just how far their money can go in Trump’s America.”</p>



<p><strong>FRIENDS IN HIGH PLACES</strong></p>



<p>Of course, having an effective AML system also relies on banks abiding by the rules that are imposed upon them, which is tricky because there’s money to be made if you welcome in customers that other institutions are excluding. And that brings us to Monzo, an online bank which gained a full British license in April 2017, and now has around 12 million customers and is valued at several billion pounds. It appeared to have some pretty high-prestige customers, considering some of them registered their addresses as “Buckingham Palace” and “10, Downing Street”, but it appears they were not being entirely truthful. Monzo was not providing bank services to the king or the prime minister, but was instead not doing basic checks on the veracity of its clients’ information.&nbsp;</p>





<p>“Monzo’s failure to gather sufficient customer data meant that the Firm was unable effectively to assess whether transactions were consistent with expected activity or were suspicious. In addition, there were weaknesses in Monzo’s transaction monitoring processes,” <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/final-notices/monzo-bank-limited.pdf">noted</a> the Financial Conduct Authority last week, as it <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/monzo-fined-28-mln-by-uk-regulator-financial-crime-failings-2025-07-08/">fined</a> the bank 21 million pounds. Monzo is a small bank, with a tiny fraction of the assets of an HSBC or a Barclays, but I’m going to go out on a limb and say it has almost certainly laundered more money internationally than South Sudan.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yet, the chances of Britain being grey-listed are nil. Perhaps the biggest flaw in the world’s AML system is that it’s a cosy club of rich countries who are all very forgiving of each other’s slips and foibles, but very willing to condemn others. Somewhere that’s perhaps deserving of more condemnation is Liechtenstein, which has an unfortunately-named <a href="https://united24media.com/latest-news/us-sanctions-turn-liechtenstein-into-a-graveyard-of-russian-wealth-vehicles-9669">zombie trust crisis</a>, caused by suddenly imposing sanctions on a financial system that had previously been very happy to provide services to wealthy Russians if not, as far as I know, to actual zombies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Tech leaders say AI will bring us eternal life, help us spread out into the stars, and build a utopian world where we never have to work. They describe a future free of pain and suffering, in which all human knowledge will be wired into our brains. Their utopian promises sound more like proselytizing than science, as if AI were the new religion and the tech bros its priests. So how are real religious leaders responding?</p>





<p>As Georgia's first female Baptist bishop, Rusudan Gotsiridze challenges the doctrines of the Orthodox Church, and is known for her passionate defence of women’s and LGBTQ+ rights. She stands at the vanguard of old religion, an example of its attempts to modernize — so what does she think of the new religion being built in Silicon Valley, where tech gurus say they are building a superintelligent, omniscient being in the form of Artificial General Intelligence?</p>



<p>Gotsiridze first tried to use AI a few months ago. The result chilled her to the bone. It made her wonder if Artificial Intelligence was in fact a benevolent force, and to think about how she should respond to it from the perspective of her religious beliefs and practices.</p>



<p>In this conversation with Coda’s Isobel Cockerell, Bishop Gotsiridze discusses the religious questions around AI: whether AI can really help us hack back into paradise, and what to make of the outlandish visions of Silicon Valley’s powerful tech evangelists.<br></p>

<p><em>This conversation took place at </em><a href="https://www.zegfest.com/"><em>ZEG Storytelling Festival</em></a><em> in Tbilisi in June 2025. It has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><strong>Isobel: </strong>Tell me about your relationship with AI right now.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>Rusudan:</strong> Well, I’d like to say I’m an AI virgin. But maybe that’s not fully honest. I had one contact with ChatGPT. I didn’t ask it to write my Sunday sermon. I just asked it to draw my portrait. How narcissistic of me. I said, “Make a portrait of Bishop Rusudan Gotsiridze.” I waited and waited. The portrait looked nothing like me. It looked like my mom, who passed away ten years ago. And it looked like her when she was going through chemo, with her puffy face. It was really creepy. So I will think twice before asking ChatGPT anything again. I know it’s supposed to be magical... but that wasn’t the best first date.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img src="https://www.codastory.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/R3.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-57195" style="width:578px;height:auto"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>AI-generated image via ChatGPT / OpenAI.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Isobel:</strong> What went through your mind when you saw this picture of your mother?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Rusudan:</strong> I thought, “Oh my goodness, it’s really a devil’s machine.” How could it go so deep? Find my facial features and connect them with someone who didn’t look like me? I take more after my paternal side. The only thing I could recognize was the priestly collar and the cross. Okay. Bishop. Got it. But yes, it was really very strange.</p>



<p><strong>Isobel:</strong> I find it so interesting that you talk about summoning the dead through Artificial Intelligence. That’s something happening in San Francisco as well. When I was there last summer, we heard about this movement that meets every Sunday. Instead of church, they hold what they call an “AI séance,” where they use AI to call up the spirit world. To call up the dead. They believe the generative art that AI creates is a kind of expression of the spirit world, an expression of a greater force.</p>



<p>They wouldn’t let us attend. We begged, but it was a closed cult. Still, a bunch of artists had the exact same experience you had: they called up these images and felt like they were summoning them, not from technology, but from another realm.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Rusudan:</strong> When you’re a religious person dealing with new technologies, it’s uncomfortable. Religion — Christianity, Protestantism, and many others — has earned a very cautious reputation throughout history because we’ve always feared progress.</p>



<p>Remember when we thought printing books was the devil’s work? Later, we embraced it. We feared vaccinations. We feared computers, the internet. And now, again, we fear AI.</p>



<p>&nbsp;It reminds me of the old proverb about a young shepherd who loved to prank his friends by shouting “Wolves! Wolves!” until one day, the wolves really came. He shouted, but no one believed him anymore.</p>



<p>We’ve been shouting “wolves” for centuries. And now, I’m this close to shouting it again, but I’m not sure.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Isobel:</strong> You said you wondered if this was the devil’s work when you saw that picture of your mother. It’s quite interesting. In Silicon Valley, people talk a lot about AI bringing about the rapture, apocalypse, hell.</p>



<p>They talk about the real possibility that AI is going to kill us all, what the endgame or extinction risk of building superintelligent models will be. Some people working in AI are predicting we’ll all be dead by 2030.</p>



<p>On the other side, people say, “We’re building utopia. We’re building heaven on Earth. A world where no one has to work or suffer. We’ll spread into the stars. We’ll be freed from death. We’ll become immortal.”</p>



<p>I’m not a religious person, but what struck me is the religiosity of these promises. And I wanted to ask you — are we hacking our way back into the Garden of Eden? Should we just follow the light? Is this the serpent talking to us?</p>



<p><strong>Rusudan:</strong> I was listening to a Google scientist. He said that in the near future, we’re not heading to utopia but dystopia. It’s going to be hell on Earth. All the world’s wealth will be concentrated in a small circle, and poverty will grow. Terrible things will happen, before we reach utopia.</p>



<p>Listening to him, it really sounded like the Book of Revelation. First the Antichrist comes, and then Christ.</p>



<p>Because of my Protestant upbringing, I’ve heard so many lectures about the exact timeline of the Second Coming. Some people even name the day, hour, place. And when those times pass, they’re frustrated. But they carry on calculating.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s hard for me to speak about dystopia, utopia, or the apocalyptic timeline, because I know nothing is going to be exactly as predicted.</p>



<p>The only thing I’m afraid of in this Artificial Intelligence era is my 2-year-old niece. She’s brilliant. You can tell by her eyes. She doesn’t speak our language yet. But phonetically, you can hear Georgian, English, Russian, even Chinese words from the reels she watches non-stop.</p>





<p>That’s what I’m afraid of: us constantly watching our devices and losing human connection. We’re going to have a deeply depressed young generation soon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I used to identify as a social person. I loved being around people. That’s why I became a priest. But now, I find it terribly difficult to pull myself out of my house to be among people. And it’s not just a technology problem — it’s a human laziness problem.</p>



<p>When we find someone or something to take over our duties, we gladly hand them over. That’s how we’re using this new technology. Yes, I’m in sermon mode now — it’s a Sunday, after all.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I want to tell you an interesting story from my previous life. I used to be a gender expert, training people about gender equality. One example I found fascinating: in a Middle Eastern village without running water, women would carry vessels to the well every morning and evening. It was their duty.</p>



<p>Western gender experts saw this and decided to help. They installed a water supply. Every woman got running water in her kitchen: happy ending. But very soon, the pipeline was intentionally broken by the women. Why? Because that water-fetching routine was the only excuse they had to leave their homes and see their friends. With running water, they became captives to their household duties.</p>



<p>One day, we may also not understand why we’ve become captives to our own devices. We’ll enjoy staying home and not seeing our friends and relatives. I don’t think we’ll break that pipeline and go out again to enjoy real life.</p>



<p><strong>Isobel:</strong> It feels like it’s becoming more and more difficult to break that pipeline. It’s not really an option anymore to live without the water, without technology.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sometimes I talk with people in a movement called the New Luddites. They also call themselves the Dumbphone Revolution. They want to create a five-to-ten percent faction of society which doesn’t have a smartphone, and they say that will help us all, because it will mean the world will still have to cater to people who don’t participate in big tech, who don’t have it in their lives. But is that the answer for all of us? To just smash the pipeline to restore human connection? Or can we have both?</p>



<p><strong>Rusudan: </strong>I was a new mom in the nineties in Georgia. I had two children at a time when we didn’t have running water. I had to wash my kids’ clothes in the yard in cold water, summer and winter. I remember when we bought our first washing machine.&nbsp; My husband and I sat in front of it for half an hour, watching it go round and round. It was paradise for me for a while.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now this washing machine is there and I don't enjoy it anymore. It's just a regular thing in my life. And when I had to wash my son’s and daughter-in-law’s wedding outfits, I didn’t trust the machine. I washed those clothes by hand. There are times when it’s important to do things by hand.</p>



<p>Of course, I don’t want to go back to a time without the internet when we were washing clothes in the yard, but there are things that are important to do without technology.</p>



<p>I enjoy painting, and I paint quite a lot with watercolors. So far, I can tell which paintings are AI and which are real. Every time I look at an AI-made watercolour, I can tell it’s not a human painting. It is a technological painting. And it's beautiful. I know I can never compete with this technology.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But that feeling, when you put your brush in, the water — sometimes I accidentally put it in my coffee cup — and when you put that brush on the paper and the pigment spreads, that feeling can never be replaced by any technology.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Isobel:</strong><strong><br></strong>As a writer, I'm now pretty good, I think, at knowing if something is AI-written or not. I'm sure in the future it will get harder to tell, but right now, there are little clues. There’s this horrible construction that AI loves: something is not just X, it’s Y. For example: “Rusudan is not just a bishop, she’s an oracle for the LGBTQ community in Georgia.” Even if you tell it to stop using that construction, it can’t. Same for the endless em-dashes: I can’t get ChatGPT to stop using them no matter how many times or how adamantly I prompt it. It's just bad writing.<br><br>It’s missing that fingerprint of imperfection that a human leaves: whether it’s an unusual sentence construction or an interesting word choice, I’ve started to really appreciate those details in real writing. I've also started to really love typos. My whole life as a journalist I was horrified by them. But now when I see a typo, I feel so pleased. It means a human wrote it. It’s something to be celebrated. It’s the same with the idea that you dip your paintbrush in the coffee pot and there’s a bit of coffee in the painting. Those are the things that make the work we make alive.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There’s a beauty in those imperfections, and that’s something AI has no understanding of. Maybe it’s because the people building these systems want to optimize everything. They are in pursuit of total perfection. But I think that the pursuit of imperfection is such a beautiful thing and something that we can strive for.</p>



<p><strong>Rusudan:</strong> Another thing I hope for with this development of AI is that it’ll change the formula of our existence. Right now, we’re constantly competing with each other. The educational system is that way. Business is that way. Everything is that way. My hope is that we can never be as smart as AI. Maybe one day, our smartness, our intelligence, will be defined not by how many books we have read, but by how much we enjoy reading books, enjoy finding new things in the universe, and how well we live life and are happy with what we do. I think there is potential in the idea that we will never be able to compete with AI, so why don’t we enjoy the book from cover to cover, or the painting with the coffee pigment or the paint? That’s what I see in the future, and I’m a very optimistic person. I suppose here you’re supposed to say “Halleluljah!”&nbsp;</p>





<p><strong>Isobel:</strong> In our podcast, <a href="https://www.audible.com/pd/Captured-Audiobook/B0DZJ5W4Y7">CAPTURED</a>, we talked with engineers and founders in Silicon Valley whose dream for the future is to install all human knowledge in our brains, so we never have to learn anything again. Everyone will speak every language! We can rebuild the Tower of Babel! They talk about the future as a paradise. But my thought was, what about finding out things? What about curiosity? Doesn’t that belong in paradise? Certainly, as a journalist, for me, some people are in it for the impact and the outcome, but I’m in it for finding out, finding the story—that process of discovery.<br><br><strong>Rusudan:</strong> It’s interesting —this idea of paradise as a place where we know everything. One of my students once asked me the same thing you just did. “What about the joy of finding new things? Where is that, in paradise?” Because in the Bible, Paul says that right now, we live in a dimension where we know very little, but there will be a time when we know everything.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the Christian narrative, paradise is a strange, boring place where people dress in funny white tunics and play the harp. And I understand that idea back then was probably a dream for those who had to work hard for everything in their everyday life — they had to chop wood to keep their family warm, hunt to get food for the kids, and of course for them, paradise was the place where they just could just lie around and do nothing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But I don’t think paradise will be a boring place. I think it will be a place where we enjoy working.</p>



<p><strong>Isobel: Do you think AI will ever replace priests?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Rusudan:</strong> I was told that one day there will be AI priests preaching sermons better than I do. People are already asking ChatGPT questions they’re reluctant to ask a priest or a psychologist. Because it’s judgment-free and their secrets are safe…ish. I don’t pretend I have all the answers because I don’t. I only have this human connection. I know there will be questions I cannot answer, and people will go and ask ChatGPT. But I know that human connection — the touch of a hand, eye-contact — can never be replaced by AI. That’s my hope. So we don’t need to break those pipelines. We can enjoy the technology, and the human connection too.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I am a regular listener to Ezra Klein’s podcast, and I’m a fan. There should be more podcasts that treat serious issues seriously, but there’s something he said <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-saikat-chakrabarti-zephyr-teachout.html">back in April</a> when talking about the root cause of problems on the Left of politics that has concerned me since I heard it. “It’s not just the fault of money in politics, because there’s money on all sides of the issues. There’s something else going on,” he said.</p>



<p>That concerned me because it encapsulated a mistake that’s often made about why political funding is problematic. It’s often assumed that the only problem is that rich people can buy support for an issue they care about, so it’s therefore often missed – as Klein did – that a far bigger problem is that they define what is considered an issue in the first place.</p>





<p>You could look at the fact that billionaires <a href="https://americansfortaxfairness.org/billionaire-clans-spend-nearly-2-billion-2024-elections/">supported </a>both Republicans and Democrats in last year’s presidential election (although far more money went to Republicans), and conclude that – since both sides got money – it’s not a big deal. Or you could wonder which issues don’t get attention because no one with money is interested in them being discussed.</p>



<p>Five years ago, when I’d just started writing this newsletter, I made a <a href="https://www.codastory.com/newsletters/oligarchs/oligarchy-august-12/">big thing</a> out of the fact that three people owned more than $100 billion. Centi-billionaires were new back then, but they’re old hat these days. Some <a href="https://www.forbes.com/real-time-billionaires/#5cdfdeb63d78">18 people</a> have passed that threshold now, and more will be along to join them very soon. <a href="https://www.oxfam.org.uk/media/press-releases/billionaire-wealth-surges-three-times-faster-in-2024-world-now-on-track-for-at-least-five-trillionaires-within-a-decade/">Oxfam predicts</a> there will be five trillionaires by the end of the decade, and that was before Donald Trump’s <a href="https://taxfoundation.org/research/all/federal/trump-tax-cuts-2025-budget-reconciliation/">tax cuts</a> were passed by Congress.</p>



<p>Last year, here in the U.K., it looked like Keir Starmer actually understood the importance of protecting politics from the corrupting effect of money, but he’s failed to actually follow through. “Time and again, Labour’s warm words about cleaning up politics have not translated into action. Rather than rebuilding faith in democracy, Starmer’s listlessness risks eroding it even further,” <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/starmer-has-broken-his-promise-end-sleaze-peter-geoghegan-b45me/">wrote</a> the journalist Peter Geoghegan last week.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, over in France, billionaire wealth has already nosed its way into politics and is <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/pierre-edouard-sterin-pericles-france-politics-marine-le-pen/">helping </a>to raise the profile of the Far Right.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Media groups, at the hands of a few powerful men,” wrote <a href="https://www.friendsofeurope.org/insights/critical-thinking-billionaire-media-empires-the-silent-erosion-of-frances-democracy/">one observer</a> late last year, “are actively shaping the political discourse in a way that normalises far-right narratives and talking points. By giving disproportionate airtime to far-right figures and framing their extremist positions as legitimate responses to France’s social and economic challenges, these media outlets are gradually shifting public opinion.”</p>



<p>It's a sign of this shift in opinion that the asset manager Aberdeen (fresh from cancelling a rebrand to ‘abrdn’, which <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/6fe7c477-c66c-48d6-be45-4485977b9d9a">cost</a> an estimated £500,000) has decided to <a href="https://www.civilsociety.co.uk/news/trustees-and-ceo-of-financial-wellbeing-charity-ousted-without-any-prior-notice.html">sack</a> the independent board of the Financial Fairness Trust, which has supported organisations researching the effects of inequality. A few years ago, that kind of philanthropy was a cheap way to look like the kind face of capitalism. These days, I’m not sure anyone cares.</p>



<p>Back when I was a cub reporter, an old-timer gave me some advice: “don’t write about process, nobody cares about process, write about results”. It’s good advice for someone trying to write articles, but it’s bad advice more broadly, because process is important. The process of drafting regulation is when laws get defined; the process of crafting the rules that will guide the implementation of laws is when questions get resolved. The power of billionaires is that they can afford to employ people to monitor that process, and to make suggestions. If the rest of us don’t care, the world will be stolen from us without any of us noticing.</p>



<p>And once it’s stolen, it’ll stay stolen. Thanks to impenetrable financial structures like a trust registered in South Dakota, the super-rich can keep their wealth safe in perpetuity. When I first <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/14/the-great-american-tax-haven-why-the-super-rich-love-south-dakota-trust-laws">wrote</a> about South Dakotan trusts, back in 2019, there was around $350 billion squirreled away in the Mount Rushmore State. That total has now hit <a href="https://www.sdpb.org/politics/2025-05-28/assets-in-south-dakota-trusts-top-800-billion">$815 billion</a>, having risen by $100 billion in the last year alone.</p>



<p>“It’s going to go on for—the estimates vary — 10 to 15 more years. But, there’s a huge transfer underway from the boomer generation to the next generation," said Bret Afdahl, the director of the state’s Banking Division.</p>



<p>Sometimes it can be hard to stay optimistic.</p>



<p><strong>THE IMAGINARY BANKER</strong></p>



<p>Here’s a <a href="https://taxpolicy.org.uk/2025/07/04/who-is-behind-fake-banks-companies-house/">weird story</a>: “meet Barbarat Giuseppe, the world’s most prolific banker. He’s run most of the world’s largest banks … Mr Giuseppe’s spectacular career is spoilt only by the small detail that it’s all fraudulent”.</p>





<p>Guiseppe may not actually exist, but he’s been able to create a series of U.K.-registered companies with the same name as major financial institutions: UBS, Goldman Sachs, and so on. When he’s been caught, he’s just created new familiar-sounding companies, perhaps as part of a money laundering scheme, though it’s not immediately clear how it would help.</p>



<p>“We need to see prosecutions. Skip the hard stuff of finding victims of fraud. Do an “Al Capone” and prosecute the easy offences instead,” writes Dan Neidle’s Tax Policy Associates. Amen to that.</p>



<p>It’s a story that shows that, despite attempted reforms, there are still major problems with many aspects of the U.K.’s company formation system. “The foundations for a successful regime are now in place, however it will take a concerted effort from across the economic crime architecture to deliver results,” <a href="https://www.transparency.org.uk/news/slow-evolution-companies-house-reform">wrote</a> Transparency International’s Ben Cowdock.</p>



<p><strong>RUSSIA’S BLOCKCHAIN BET</strong></p>



<p>Last week, I wrote about how Russia was moving money via crypto and Kyrgyzstan to evade Western restrictions on its financial sector, and here’s an interesting <a href="https://astraea-group.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2025.06.30-Astraea-Article_Russia-is-one-step-ahead-in-the-game-of-crypto-whack-a-mole_KK-Alexandr-Chernykh.pdf">analysis</a> of the phenomenon. “Russia is building a parallel financial system using blockchain as its backbone,” writes analysts from Astraea. “This network presents a growing challenge for regulators and underscores the urgency of developing coordinated international responses to crypto-based sanctions evasion.”&nbsp;<br></p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Is the Kremlin’s contested influence in Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia a sign of its waning relevance?</p>
<p>The post <a href="https://www.codastory.com/disinformation/resisting-the-authoritarian-playbook-in-the-south-caucasus/">Resisting the Authoritarian Playbook in the South Caucasus</a> appeared first on <a href="https://www.codastory.com">Coda Story</a>.</p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Recent events in the South Caucasus show how the authoritarian playbook is exported and adapted to suit local contexts. From Armenia’s clergy allegedly plotting coups, to Azerbaijan raiding Russian state-funded media offices as retribution, to Georgia’s mass arrests of opposition leaders, the region revealed how authoritarianism and resistance to it adapts and spreads through digital-age tactics.</p>





<p>The three nations of the South Caucasus: Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia, have long occupied a place of strategic and symbolic importance for Russia. The region is a vital transit corridor linking Europe, Asia, and the Middle East, making it a coveted prize for energy routes and geopolitical influence. For Moscow, the South Caucasus has always been more than a neighboring periphery, it is an enduring obsession. And perhaps more so now, as Russia’s position in the Middle East has <a href="https://www.codastory.com/armed-conflict/the-empire-game-2-0-through-moscows-eyes/">weakened</a> following setbacks in Syria and its diminished sway in Iran. Today, the Kremlin’s desire to assert control in the South Caucasus is as strong as ever. Yet in each of these three countries, Moscow’s efforts to shape events and narratives are meeting unprecedented resistance. The divergent responses—ranging from defiance to accommodation—highlight how the authoritarian playbook is being adapted, contested, and exported across the region.</p>



<p>So what constitutes this <a href="https://www.codastory.com/the-playbook/">playbook</a>? Legal weaponization through foreign agent laws, criminalization of dissent with disproportionate penalties, systematic impunity for state violence, economic warfare against independent media, and international narrative manipulation. Below are three examples:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Armenia: Hybrid war and the Kremlin’s shadow</strong><strong><br></strong></h3>



<p>Armenia, once Moscow’s closest ally in the South Caucasus, has openly expressed disillusion with years of Russian inaction during regional crises. Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan now <a href="https://radar.am/en/news/politics-2700496444/">warns</a> of “hybrid actions and hybrid war” from Russian circles, without directly blaming the Kremlin, while the EU and France step in to support his decision to jail clergymen in defence of Armenian democracy. The clerics were accused of plotting a coup. Fingers were also pointed at Russian-Armenian businessman Samvel Karapetyan, the alleged orchestrator. It was, in one analyst’s words. Moscow’s “Ivanishvili 2.0 operation”, a reference to Bidzina Ivanishvili, the billionaire founder and de facto leader of Georgian Dream, Georgia’s ruling party since 2012. Georgian Dream, under Ivanishvili, has steered Georgia in an increasingly illiberal and pro-Russian direction. But for a couple of years now, the Armenian government has been gradually distancing itself from Russia, hedging its bets rather than relying on Moscow to guarantee security. In the aftermath of the alleged coup attempt, Armenia’s Foreign Minister bluntly <a href="https://www.eurasiareview.com/01072025-armenian-fm-urges-russia-to-respect-internal-affairs/">told</a> Russian officials that they “must treat Armenia’s sovereignty with great respect and never again allow themselves to interfere in our internal affairs.” Pashinyan has of late made conciliatory gestures towards both of Armenia’s arch-rivals, Azerbaijan and Turkey. The loss of Nagorno-Karabakh to Azerbaijan — while Russian peacekeepers stood by — largely drove Armenia toward European integration as an existential necessity. Armenia's experience with alleged coup plot, and its possible Russian backing, shows how the playbook adapts to different political contexts, exploiting religious institutions and diaspora networks to destabilize governments that drift from Moscow's orbit.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Azerbaijan: Asserting independence, testing the edges&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>The <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/azerbaijan-police-raid-russias-sputnik-media-offices/a-73097961">raid</a> on Russian state media offices in Baku last&nbsp; week sent an unmistakable message about the limits of Moscow’s influence in the region. The targeting of Sputnik journalists came after violent police action in Russia in which two Azerbaijani nationals were killed, an incident Baku condemned as ethnically motivated. For years, Azerbaijan has been systematically <a href="https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/why-azerbaijan-russia-relations-are-breaking-point">moving out</a> of Moscow’s orbit, growing closer to Turkey and unafraid to assert itself in disputes with Russia. The arrests of Russian journalists represent more than bilateral tensions; they signal how even traditionally Moscow-aligned states now calculate that defying Russia carries fewer costs than submission. Russia’s response — summoning the Azerbaijani ambassador and protesting the “dismantling of bilateral relations” — revealed Moscow’s diminished leverage. Azerbaijan’s confidence stems from military victories in Nagorno-Karabakh, increased energy exports to Europe, and strategic ties with Turkey that provide alternatives to a subservient partnership with Russia. Azerbaijan's bold move illustrates another dimension of the regional dynamic: how countries with strong alternative partnerships can successfully resist Russian pressure tactics, even when those tactics include media warfare and diplomatic intimidation.<br></p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Georgia: The authoritarian laboratory</strong>&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Georgia presents the starkest illustration of both the Kremlin’s enduring shadow and the systematic deployment of authoritarian tactics. The ruling Georgian Dream party has implemented what Transparency International calls a “full-scale authoritarian offensive,” with eight opposition figures <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/1/opposition-leader-nika-gvaramia-jailed-in-georgia-amid-deepening-crackdown">jailed</a> in just a single week. The crackdown follows months of mass protests against the foreign agent law — a carbon copy of Russian legislation designed to crush civil society. Among those arrested is Nika Gvaramia, the former head of the country’s leading opposition TV channel, who spent a year in prison, received the Committee to Protect Journalists’ International Press Freedom Award, and emerged to found his own political party. Now Gvaramia faces another eight-month sentence plus a two-year ban from holding office, an example of how the repressive state systematically eliminates viable opposition while maintaining a veneer of legal process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The foreign agent law itself has become a remarkably successful Russian export — <a href="https://www.codastory.com/disinformation/russias-foreign-agents-law-reverberates-around-the-world/">a tool</a> used from Nicaragua to Egypt to stigmatize independent civil society as “trojan horses” serving foreign interests. In Georgia, the law forces organizations receiving over 20% foreign funding to register as entities “pursuing the interests of a foreign power,” enabling harsh monitoring requirements and the systematic isolation of critics.<br><br>Since Russia pioneered the foreign agent model in 2012, it has been adopted by countries including Nicaragua, where it has been used to shut down over 3,000 civil society organizations, and Hungary, where officials explicitly cited the US FARA law as justification when facing international criticism. The model's appeal to authoritarian leaders lies in its appearance of legitimacy — claiming to mirror democratic precedents while systematically dismantling civil society. The chilling effect extends beyond legal restrictions.<br><br>Physical attacks on journalists have become routine, with not a single perpetrator facing accountability. Instead, the state's message is unmistakable: challenge us, and you will pay. According to the 2025 World Press Freedom Index, economic pressure has become a critical threat to media freedom globally, with the economic indicator hitting an “unprecedented, critical low” of 44.1 points — Georgia exemplifies this trend through its systematic economic warfare against independent outlets.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Mzia’s story&nbsp; </strong><strong><br></strong></h3>



<p>The story&nbsp; of one Georgian journalist Mzia Amaghlobeli, founder of two independent newsrooms Batumelebi and Netgazeti, is a textbook case of how modern authoritarianism operates through seemingly proportional responses to manufactured crises.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Amaglobeli was taken into custody for placing a solidarity sticker reading “Georgia goes on strike” and subsequently slapping Police Chief Irakli Dgebuadze after hours of degrading treatment, including watching colleagues being beaten by police.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Amaglobeli was arrested for assaulting a police officer, but many suspect her journalism was the real target. The charges against Amaglobeli — from “distorting a building’s appearance” for the removable sticker to “attacking an officer” — could mean seven years in prison. Evidence has been manipulated, timelines don’t match, and the authorities’ narrative shifts with each wave of international criticism. During detention, she was subjected to degrading treatment — insulted, spat upon, and denied access to water and toilets.</p>



<p>“It’s not only her being on trial, it’s independent media being on trial in Georgia,” said Irma Dimitradze, Amaghlobeli’s colleague who is now leading the global campaign to free her. She was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy8ir5ZG-iw">speaking</a> at Coda’s annual <a href="https://www.zegfest.com/">ZEG Fest</a> along with Jodie Ginsberg, CEO of the Committee to Protect Journalists; human rights barrister Caoilfhionn Gallagher, and Nobel laureate and co-founder of Rappler Maria Ressa. All three argued that the systematic nature of the persecution of Amaglobeli reveals the broader strategy that’s similar the world over. Her case demonstrates how authoritarian systems create conditions where any human response to injustice becomes criminal evidence.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As Caoilfhionn Gallagher put it: “You are not dealing here with a rule of law compliant system... there’s a whole series of absolutely farcical things which have happened in this case so far. The criminal investigation was headed by the officer who was the alleged victim. I mean these are…you couldn’t make this stuff up, really... it is clear that in Georgia you are not going to get a fair trial. She hasn’t had due process yet and really what's going to make the difference here is ensuring that the world is watching and that there's a proper international strategy.”</p>





<p>After a 38-day hunger strike, Amaglobeli remains defiant, standing for hours in court, refusing to sit, determined to show she cannot be broken. Her symbolic gesture of holding up Ressa’s book, “How to Stand Up to a Dictator”, during court appearances has <a href="https://newunionpost.eu/2025/01/29/mzia-amaghlobeli-detention-georgia/">become</a> an icon of resistance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We know,” said Ressa, “that journalism around the world is under attack.” With 72% of the world’s population <a href="https://www.v-dem.net/documents/29/V-dem_democracyreport2023_lowres.pdf#:~:text=72%25%20of%20the%20world%27s%20population%20%E2%80%93%205.7,billion%20people%20%E2%80%93%20live%20in%20liberal%20democracies.">living</a> under authoritarian rule, added Ressa, “the time to protect our rights is now.” Gallagher spoke about the “power of international solidarity,” how what authoritarians fear is “journalism with a purpose, with an editorial line which is designed to undermine the false narratives and the gaslighting on a grand scale.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>There are cities that teach you to read between the lines, to notice the way the air shifts before history changes course. Beirut in 2008 was one of those cities. A familiar cast filled its glitzy bars and air conditioned coffee shops: correspondents, fixers, schemers, dreamers – but beneath the surface, the city was still reeling from the earth-shattering assassination in 2005 of its former prime minister Rafic Hariri. Beirut was caught between recovery and reckoning, not yet knowing that the region's biggest earthquake was still gathering force just across the border.</p>



<p>It was in this world that I found myself, the latest addition to the city's English-speaking press corps. I had landed as the BBC's correspondent, but unlike most of my on-air colleagues at the time, I had an accent no one could quite place and a backstory most of my fellow foreign correspondents would have struggled to map. Except for <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/722123/a-stranger-in-your-own-city-by-ghaith-abdul-ahad/">Ghaith Abdul-Ahad</a>, the other accented foreigner in Beirut's lively foreign correspondents group.</p>



<p>In Beirut, like all foreign correspondents Ghaith and I were outsiders to the country we were reporting on, but we were also outsiders trying to break into an industry that was reluctant to accept us. I remember at one particularly loud Beirut media party, a middle-aged man shouted into my ear that the new BBC correspondent's accent was a disgrace, an act of disrespect to British listeners. He didn't realize he was speaking to that very correspondent.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://www.codastory.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/unnamed.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-57084"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ghaith Abdul-Ahad’s notebooks are filled not just with his notes from the&nbsp; Middle East but with sketches.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Ghaith meanwhile had made his way from an architecture school in Baghdad (evident in the skill he brings to his sketches) onto the pages of The Guardian, somehow transforming the drawbridge of the British media establishment into an open door.&nbsp; But it wasn’t our struggle that we bonded over – it was bananas. Or, more precisely, the scarcity thereof.</p>



<p>In Saddam’s Iraq, I learned from Ghaith, much like in the Soviet Georgia of my childhood, the lack of bananas turned them into more than a fruit. They were a symbol of luxury, a crescent-shaped promise that somewhere life was sweet and abundant. Most kids like us, who grew up dreaming of bananas, set out to chase abundance in Europe or America as adults. For whatever reasons, Ghaith and I chose the reverse commute, drawn to the abundance of stories in places that others wanted to flee.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ghaith and I decided to turn our community of two into a secret club we called  “Journalists Without Proper Passports”: JPP, or was it JwPP. We couldn’t quite agree on the acronym, but it became a running joke about the strange calculus of turning what you lack into what you offer. Our passports, while pretty useless for weekend trips to Europe or getting U.S. visas, worked miracles for getting into places like Libya, Yemen, Uzbekistan, Burma, and Iran.</p>



<p>On a trip to Afghanistan, Ghaith left his Beirut apartment keys with a fresh face who had just arrived in the city: Josh Hersh. Josh, I only recently learned, had been agonizing over whether he should move from New York to Beirut, coming up with excuse after excuse not to make the leap. "In April, I'm gonna be in Afghanistan," Ghaith had told him when they met. "You can stay in my apartment, no problem." Just like that, Josh had no more excuses. And so, while Ghaith was in&nbsp; Afghanistan, Josh was settling into Beirut's rhythm, discovering what the rest of us already knew: that the city had a way of making you feel like you belonged, even when you clearly didn't.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video autoplay loop muted poster="https://www.codastory.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/sketches_mov_avc_240p.original.jpg" src="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/6S52jnDY/sketches.mov" playsinline></video><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ghaith Abdul-Ahad leafs through his reporter notebook.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Josh had a keen reporter’s eye for things the rest of us missed. I remember one night at Barometre – a sweaty, crowded Palestinian bar where men spun in circles to music that seemed to defy gravity – Josh and I slipped outside for air. He pointed at my beer and said, "You aren't really drinking that, are you?" Just like that, he'd guessed my secret: I was pregnant. That was Josh's gift – listening and watching harder than anyone else, catching the detail that unlocks the rest of the story.</p>



<p>The gift was on full display when, almost two decades after they met, Ghaith and Josh sat down in Tbilisi at ZEG, our annual storytelling festival. Josh was interviewing Ghaith at ZEG for Kicker, his podcast for Columbia Journalism Review.<br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.codastory.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GAA_12_pan_mosul-1-1800x475.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-57115"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">A panorama of destruction in the old city of Mosul.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The conversation happened at a moment when the Middle East was literally on the brink of a wider war. The old fault lines – sectarian, geopolitical, generational – were shifting beneath our feet. And Ghaith's words felt both urgent and timeless, a reminder that beneath every headline about good guys and bad guys are people making desperate choices about survival. Unlike many of us, who eventually scattered to desk jobs at a comfortable distance from the action, Ghaith is still the one regularly slipping into Damascus and Sana’a, telling stories that – as Josh put it “refuse to moralize”, to categorize people as heroes or traitors, insisting instead on the messy, human reality of survival.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At ZEG, he talked about Mustafa, a young man in Damascus who became a "reluctant collaborator" with the Syrian regime – not out of ideology, but out of a desperate calculus for survival. "My rule number one: I will never be beaten up ever again," Ghaith recounted Mustafa saying. "And of course, he gets beaten up again and again and again." It's a line that lands with particular force now, as the region cycles through yet another round of violence, and the world tries once more to flatten its tragedies into headlines.</p>



<p>Ghaith also spoke about the legacy of violence that shapes the region's present – and its future: "That's the legacy, the trauma of violence, that is the biggest problem in this region, I think. It is an organic reason why these cycles perpetuate themselves."</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.codastory.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GAA_01_detainees-1800x704.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-57073"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Iranian men are rounded up and detained by the Americans in a village south of Baghdad circa 2005.</figcaption></figure>



<p>And then there was his insight into how the West – and the world – misunderstands the Middle East: "At one point, I realized there is no one conflict crossing the region from Tehran to Sana'a via Baghdad and Damascus. But a constellation of smaller conflicts utilized for a bigger one… It's so much easier to understand the conflict in the Middle East as Iran versus the Sunnis or the Jihadis versus Israel. But if we see it as a local conflict, I think it's much more difficult, but it's much more interesting."</p>



<p>"My anger with Americans is not only destroying Iraq, not only committing massacres and whatnot, and not a single person went to jail for the things they did in Iraq. Not George Bush. Not Nouri al-Maliki. No one has ever stood and said, well, I'm sorry for the things we've done. We will never have a proper reconciliation because the same trauma of violence and sectarianism will be repackaged and will travel to Syria, to Yemen and come back to haunt this region. And that's my problem. And this is why I'm angry."</p>



<p>Josh, with his characteristic gentleness, pressed Ghaith on these patterns and the craft of reporting on them. And Ghaith, ever the reluctant protagonist, brushed aside the idea of bravery: "I'm scared all the time. Not sometimes, but all the time. But also, I think it's not about me. I want to tell the story of Mustafa, of the other people on the ground. I don't want to be distracted by my own story, reading “War and Peace” in a Taliban detention cell."</p>





<p>When the session ended, people didn't leave with answers – they left with better questions. There was that electric feeling you get when a conversation has broken something open, when the neat categories we use to understand the world have been gently but firmly dismantled. In that room, for an hour, we weren't talking about "the Middle East" as an abstraction, but about the weight of history on individual lives.</p>



<p>In a moment when the region is once again at the center of the world's anxieties, when the language of "good guys" and "bad guys" is being weaponized by everyone from politicians to algorithms, we need conversations that refuse to let us off the hook. We need the kind of journalism that Ghaith practices, journalism that insists on the messy, contradictory reality of people's lives, that sees the individual inside the collective tragedy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p> When I lived in Bishkek 25 years ago, then-president Askar Akayev was so effusive in expressing his desire for Kyrgyzstan to become the Switzerland of Central Asia that the Swiss ambassador once joked that Akayev liked his homeland better than he did.&nbsp;</p>





<p>It was a pretty understandable hope - who wouldn’t want their poor ex-Soviet republic to become as prosperous and stable as Switzerland? – but it was a forlorn one. Both countries are multilingual and mountainous, but have little else in common. In the end, Akayev fled to Russia, his fall precipitated by the Tulip Revolution. He was the first of three presidents to be chased out of office, only for each new government to be every bit as corrupt and incompetent as those that were overthrown.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But will it be sanctions-dodging that finally brings Kyrgyzstan and Switzerland together? There is already substantial <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/transshipments-from-the-eu-to-russia/">transhipment</a> of physical goods via Kyrgyz companies to help Russians access goods they’re supposedly barred from purchasing, including <a href="https://www.occrp.org/en/feature/we-know-no-borders-how-kyrgyzstan-became-a-hub-for-sanctioned-car-exports-to-russia">luxury cars</a>, but the business appears to be becoming more elaborate.</p>



<p><strong>A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY</strong></p>



<p>Back in April, the former Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao (he stepped down after being <a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/changpeng-zhao/">jailed </a>in the US, but still owns most of the company) announced that he was advising Kyrgyzstan on crypto reforms. “Such initiatives are crucial for the sustainable growth of the economy and the security of virtual assets, ultimately generating new opportunities for businesses and society as a whole,” <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-founder-changpeng-zhao-advise-kyrgyzstan-crypto">said</a> current president Sadyr Zhaparov at the time.</p>



<p>In May, we heard that Kyrgyzstan <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/05/05/kyrgyzstan-s-gold-backed-dollar-pegged-stablecoin-usdkg-to-debut-in-q3">plans</a> to launch a dollar-pegged stablecoin called USDKG which, fascinatingly, will be backed not – as it is at Tether (USDT) or Circle – with dollar assets, but with $500 million worth of gold from the Kyrgyz government.</p>



<p>“Anyone holding USDKG can redeem it for physical gold in Kyrgyzstan, exchange it for crypto like USDT, or withdraw it as fiat through the traditional banking system,” <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/the-state-backed-stablecoin-to-change-kyrgyzstans-and-global-economy-ama-recap-with-gold-dollar-usdkg">said</a> William Campbell, who is advising the government in Bishkek on the venture.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Apparently, the aim is for the cryptocurrency to be used for remittances back to Kyrgyzstan from citizens abroad, as well as legal tender inside the country, but it also looks like an open invitation to money laundering and sanctions dodging. If USDKG works the way he says it will, it will be a state-approved backdoor linking the gold market, the traditional financial system, and the crypto world. It would be in short a 21st-century version of what Switzerland used to be for Nazis, dictators, mafiosi, spies and tax-dodgers, before the rest of the world forced it to go straight (ish).</p>



<p>Last week, the FT published a <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/1c71cac0-b86b-4361-8f54-ee5d3bb5a489">fascinating</a> investigation into how a fugitive Moldovan oligarch and a Russian bank have created a rouble-backed stablecoin called A7A5, which they are trading in Kyrgyzstan, effectively to gain access to USDT, which they lost when the Garantex exchange was <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/garantex-cryptocurrency-exchange-disrupted-international-operation">shut</a> under U.S. pressure in March.</p>



<p>“(It is a) friendly jurisdiction that is not so subject to sanctions”, said A7A5’s director Leonid Shumakov. “It is no secret that this jurisdiction is currently helping a lot to cope with the pressure [Russia] is under.”</p>



<p>Earlier this year, the United States <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2785#:~:text=The%20purchase%20of%20Keremet%20Bank,and%20receive%20payment%20for%20exports.">sanctioned</a> a Kyrgyz bank that it suspected was trying “to create a sanctions evasion hub for Russia to pay for imports and receive payment for exports”. But it’s not clear what it can do about a stablecoin if it has no connection to the U.S. financial system and therefore no reason to fear the Department of the Treasury.</p>



<p>History shows that when a sufficiently large number of rich people or companies become discontented by government restrictions on what they can do with their money, they will find a jurisdiction willing to earn fees by helping them evade those obstacles. This is how places as varied as Hong Kong, Dubai, the Cayman Islands and Delaware earn a living, and it would not be a surprise if Kyrgyzstan were to join them.</p>



<p><strong>SHEDDING LIGHT ON THE DARK ECONOMY</strong></p>



<p>Britain of course is the granddaddy of all the tax havens, so it’s heartening to see evidence that reforms to try to clean up its rotten financial system are starting to have some effect. In 2023, parliament passed a law to prevent British companies from being quite so perfect a vehicle for the committing of financial crimes, and the corporate registry has issued a <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/685010789d538361ad2da732/second-progress-report-on-the-implementation-and-operation-of-parts-1-to-3-of-the-economic-crime-and-corporate-transparency-act-2023.pdf">progress report</a>.</p>



<p>Highlights include the fact that tens of thousands of fraudulent companies have been struck off the register, many other companies have been forced to update their information to make it accurate, and attempts to create companies with false information have been prevented. Applicants are going to have to verify their identity before they file information, but will also have the right to prevent that information becoming public if it would pose a risk to themselves.</p>



<p>It wasn’t long ago that Companies House was the preferred source for cheap, reliable shell companies used in money laundering scandals globally. And it is genuinely brilliant that efforts are being made to prevent that from happening again (although there is still a long way to go).</p>



<p>It’s interesting as well that UK law enforcement agencies are <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/sfo-cracks-down-on-corruption-through-international-alliance">trying</a> to build ties with foreign counterparts in order to tackle corruption and financial crime, not least since they appear to be trying to encourage American agencies not to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/sfo-and-doj-affirm-commitment-to-joint-working-to-tackle-crime">retreat</a> from the fight. It will of course take more than a few nice words from the Brits to enthuse Donald Trump’s White House about the merits of fighting corruption, particularly considering the number of attorneys tackling investigations under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act <a href="https://us.transparency.org/resource/four-takeaways-from-the-dojs-new-guidelines-on-the-foreign-corrupt-practices-act/">appears</a> to have been halved.</p>





<p>While on the subject of international cooperation, <a href="https://www.taxobservatory.eu/www-site/uploads/2025/06/WP33_When-Bankers-Become-Informants.pdf">here’s</a> an interesting paper about the effect on a bank in the Isle of Man of the automatic exchange of information, which was brought in after the 2007-8 financial crisis to make it harder for people to dodge tax. Its analysis is based on leaked data and only covers one relatively small bank in one relatively small jurisdiction, but appears to reveal some pretty significant flaws in the regulations, which may make them less effective than we’d hoped.</p>



<p>And while on the subject of tax havens, the British Virgin Islands has issued <a href="https://bvi.gov.vg/media-centre/bvi-publishes-policy-legitimate-interest-access-beneficial-ownership-register">proposals</a> for how it might make its corporate registry less opaque, and they are not great. “Most alarmingly,” <a href="https://www.transparency.org.uk/news/bvis-company-register-plans-not-compatible-global-transparency-efforts-warn-anti-corruption">said</a> Transparency International’s Margot Mollat, “the policy of notifying company owners when their information is accessed puts journalists and civil society actors at serious risk of retaliation and legal intimidation.” This isn’t transparency, Mollat added, “it’s a system that will frustrate scrutiny and protect dirty money”.&nbsp;<br></p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>With the US operation in Iran triggering fresh arms races, Russia’s turn from multipolarity to imperial nostalgia highlights a global order in turmoil—and Moscow’s battle to remain at the center of it</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Earlier this week, as the Iranian defense minister headed to Qingdao for a Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit, Donald Trump was basking in the spotlight at a NATO gathering in the Netherlands, claiming credit for brokering a Middle East truce. But beneath the headlines, one untold story was about who gets to shape the new world order, and how Russia, once a regional kingmaker, is now struggling to define its place. <strong><br></strong><strong><br></strong>As old alliances crack, Russia is scrambling to shape a new global order. Its answer: an unexpected bold imperial narrative that promises stability but reveals deep anxieties about Moscow’s place in a world where legitimacy, history, and power are all being contested.</p>





<p>The Iranian defense minister’s trip to Qingdao - his first foreign visit since the ceasefire with Israel - was meant to signal solidarity within the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, a block that includes Russia, India, and Pakistan. But the SCO, despite its ambitions, could only muster a joint statement of “serious concern” over Middle East tensions when Iran was being bombed by Israel - a statement India <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/6/16/why-india-refused-to-join-sco-condemnation-of-israels-attacks-on-iran">refused</a> to sign. This exposed the stark limits of alternative alliances and the growing difficulty of presenting a united front against the West. In Qingdao, Andrei Belousov, the Russian defense minister, warned of “worsening geopolitical tensions” and “signs of further deterioration,” a statement that’s hard to argue with.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, in the Netherlands, Trump relished his role as global peacemaker, claiming credit for an uneasy Israel-Iran truce - a truce that Russia welcomed while being careful to credit Qatar for its diplomatic efforts. Russia itself reportedly played a supporting role alongside Oman and Egypt. But the real diplomatic heavy lifting was done by others - and Russia’s own leverage&nbsp; was exposed as limited.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once the region’s indispensable power broker, Moscow found itself on the sidelines. Its influence with Tehran diminished, and its air defense systems in Iran—meant to deter Israeli and later American strikes—were exposed as ineffective. With Bashar al-Assad’s rule in Syria collapsed, the Kremlin is acutely aware it cannot afford to lose another major ally in the region. As long as the Iranian government stands, Russia can still claim to have a role to play, but its ability to project power in the Middle East is now more symbolic than real. The 12-day war put Russia in an awkward position. Iran, a key supplier of drones for Russia’s war in Ukraine, was unimpressed by Moscow’s lack of support during the crisis. Even after signing a 20-year pact in January, Russia offered little more than “grave concern” when the bombs started falling. Similarly to the SCO, BRICS, supposedly the alternative to Western alliances, could only issue a joint statement, revealing just how thin multipolarity is in practice.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.codastory.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/EVGENIA-NOVOZHENINA-POOL-AFP-via-Getty-Images-1796x1200.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-56998"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin with the Iranian national flag in the background during a state visit by his Iranian counterpart.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Enter the new narrative spin</h2>



<p>For years, Vladimir Putin has argued that the West’s “rules-based order” is little more than a tool for maintaining Western dominance and justifying double standards. His <a href="https://www.codastory.com/rewriting-history/how-the-west-lost-the-war-it-thought-it-had-won/">vision</a> of multipolarity is not just anti-American rhetoric—it’s a deliberate strategy to appeal to countries disillusioned by Western interventions, broken promises, and the arrogance of those who claimed victory in the Cold War. Russia has worked to turn Western failures—from Iraq to Afghanistan, from Libya to the global financial crisis—into recruitment tools for its own vision of “civilizational diversity.” Multipolarity, in the Kremlin’s telling, is about giving every culture, every nation, a seat at the table, while quietly reserving the right to redraw the map and rewrite the rules when it suits Moscow’s interests.</p>



<p>For a time, this approach was paying off. Russia’s anti-colonial and multipolar rhetoric resonated well beyond its borders, particularly in the Global South and among those frustrated by Western hypocrisy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But across the periphery of Russia’s historical empire, from Central Asia to the Baltics, from the Caucasus to Ukraine and Georgia, Russia’s multipolar message is seen not as liberation but as yet another chapter in a centuries-long cycle of conquest, repression and forced assimilation - a reality that continues to define the struggle for self-determination across Russia’s former empire.&nbsp; Here, Russia’s message of “<a href="https://www.codastory.com/rewriting-history/russia-colonialism-georgia-ukraine/">sameness</a>” has long served as a colonial tool, erasing languages, cultures, and identities in the name of imperial unity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The recent conflict in the Middle East has forced Moscow to adapt its “multipolarity” messaging yet again. As its limitations as a regional power became impossible to ignore, Russian state media and officials began to reframe the conversation—no longer just championing multipolarity, but openly embracing the language of empire. In this new narrative, ‘empire’ is recast not as a relic of oppression, but as a stabilizing force uniquely capable of imposing order on an unruly world. The pivot is as much about masking diminished leverage as it is about projecting confidence: if Moscow can no longer dictate outcomes, it can still claim the mantle of indispensable power by rewriting the very terms of global legitimacy.</p>



<p>As<strong> </strong>we peered into the abyss of World War III, Russian state media pivoted: suddenly, ‘empire’—long a slur—was rebranded as a stabilizing force in a chaotic world.</p>



<p>This rhetorical shift has been swift and striking. Where once the Kremlin denounced imperialism as a Western vice, Russian commentators now argue that empires are not only inevitable but necessary for stability. “Empires could return to world politics not only as dark shadows of the past. Empire may soon become a buzzword for discussing the direction in which the world’s political organization is heading,” <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/616753-empire-returns-new-global-order/">wrote</a> one Russian analyst. The message is clear: in an age of chaos and fractured alliances, only a strong imperial center—preferably Moscow—can guarantee order. But beneath the surface, this embrace of empire reveals as much uncertainty as ambition, exposing deep anxieties about Russia’s place in a world it can no longer control as it once did.</p>



<p>Inside Russia, this new imperial rhetoric is both a rallying cry and a reflection of unease. In recent weeks, influential analysts have argued that Iran’s restraint—its so-called “peacefulness”—only invited aggression, a warning that resonates with those who fear Russia could be next. Enter Alexander Dugin, the far-right philosopher often described as “Putin’s <a href="https://www.wsj.com/world/russia/alexander-dugin-russia-putin-trump-voters-1740f271">brain</a>,” whose apocalyptic worldview has shaped much of the Kremlin’s confrontational posture. Dugin <a href="https://www.rt.com/russia/620253-if-iran-falls-were-next/">warns</a> that if the U.S. and Israel can strike Tehran with impunity, nothing would stop them from finding a pretext to strike Moscow. This siege mentality, echoed by senior officials, is now being used to justify a strategy of escalation and deterrence at any cost.</p>



<p>Dugin’s views were <a href="https://www.rt.com/russia/620253-if-iran-falls-were-next/">echoed</a> by Konstantin Kosachev, chair of the Russian parliamentary foreign affairs committee: “If you don’t want to be bombed by the West, arm yourself. Build deterrence. Go all the way—even to the point of developing weapons of mass destruction.”</p>





<p>But for all the talk of “victory,” by all sides post the 12-day war,&nbsp; the outcomes remain ambiguous. Iran insists its nuclear ambitions are undimmed. While Israel and Trump’s team says Iran is further from a bomb than ever before – still, the facts are murky and the region is no closer to peace. As one Russian analyst remarked, the normalization of “phoney war” logic means that everyone is arming up, alliances are transactional, and the rules are made up as we go along.</p>



<p>If the only lesson of the 12-day war is that everyone must arm themselves to the teeth, we’re not just reliving the Cold War—we’re entering a new era of empire-building, where deterrence is everything and the lines between friend and foe are as blurred as ever.</p>



<p>In a world where old alliances crumble and new narratives emerge, the true battle, it seems, is not just over territory or military might, but over the stories that define power itself. Russia’s pivot to an imperial narrative reveals both its ambitions and its anxieties, highlighting a global order in flux where legitimacy is contested and the rules are rewritten in real time. Understanding this evolving empire game is essential to grasping the future of international relations and the fragile balance that holds the world together.<br></p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-this-story">Why Did We Write This Story?</h3>



<p class="is-style-sans has-small-font-size">Because the world’s rules are being rewritten in real time. As the US flexes its military muscle and Moscow pivots from multipolarity to imperial nostalgia, we’re watching not just a contest of armies, but a battle over who gets to define legitimacy, history, and power itself. Russia’s new “empire” narrative isn’t just about the Kremlin’s ambitions—it’s a window into the anxieties and fractures shaping the next global order. At Coda, we believe understanding these narrative shifts is essential to seeing where the world is headed, and who stands to win—or lose—as the lines between friend and foe blur.</p>

<p>Years of sanctions have substantially weakened the Iranian economy, as evidenced by Iran’s <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/6/2/iran-demands-sanctions-relief-guarantee-in-nuclear-talks-with-us">keenness</a> to have them cancelled, with sanctions removal a key sticking point in negotiations with the U.S. before Israel began bombing Iranian nuclear sites on June 13. But anyone who thinks sanctions are an all-powerful tool should spend some time speaking to Tehran businessmen. The exchange houses in the bazaar in Tehran can arrange money transfers to and from anywhere you like, no matter what the Office of Foreign Assets Control says.</p>



<p>It’s all coordinated via encrypted messaging apps and, as long as you’re transacting with a major centre like London, Paris or New York, your cash will be ready for collection within a couple of hours. “You can get paid electronically if you have a bank account. You need to be a bit careful about having lots of random payments coming into your account, but otherwise it’s straightforward,” one Iranian told me.</p>





<p>The trick is the same one used at various times and on various continents in <a href="https://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/who-we-are/publications/445-chinese-underground-banking/file">Chinese Underground Banking</a>, <a href="https://www.dowjones.com/professional/risk/resources/risk-blog/hawala-risks">hawala</a> transfers, or the <a href="https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/advisory/advisu9.pdf">Black Market Peso Exchange</a>, all of which also exist to provide financial services outside the Western-dominated financial system. Instead of moving money electronically through bank accounts, they transfer value through the trade network, something that Western policy makers really struggle to get a grip of, not least because they often don’t understand what’s going on.</p>



<p><strong>A DIGITAL ACT OF WAR</strong></p>



<p>Cryptocurrencies have really supercharged these networks because, instead of moving value in a shipload of used cars or a container of designer handbags, which take weeks to reach their final destination and are cumbersome to buy, move and sell, they can be shifted quickly, easily and with minimal time delay. Hawaladars can now shift value between countries with their phones, and the sarafis in Tehran are all using Tether, despite the fact they’re <a href="https://tether.to/en/in-what-countries-and-states-does-tether-have-limited-functionality/">not</a> supposed to (I mean, neither are Venezuelans, but that hasn’t <a href="https://www.hklaw.com/-/media/files/insights/publications/2024/05/pdvsaturnstocryptocurrenciesen.pdf?rev=f3d9bfb391664e38becdb4a264c31a3b&amp;hash=893DBD624A0177B0EE20B954FF96F7FD">stopped</a> the national oil company).</p>



<p>This is why last week’s <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/israels-predatory-sparrow-hackers-are-waging-cyberwar-on-irans-financial-system/">hack</a> by the Israel-linked group Predatory Sparrow (who are presumably unrelated to calypso king Mighty Sparrow, but I’ll take any excuse to link to this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjPdpCV2kFY">banger</a>) is so interesting. By <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-crypto-exchange-hit-by-hackers-90-million-destroyed-2025-06-18/">raiding</a> $90 million from Tehran’s Nobitex crypto exchange it was striking a blow against the informal financial ties between Iranians and the rest of the world. The lost cryptocurrencies included, <a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/nobitex-iranian-exchange-exploit-june-2025/">according</a> to Chainalysis, “Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, Ripple, Solana, Tron, and Ton” although the hackers didn’t actually steal them but instead sent them to addresses from which they could not be retrieved, which is a bit like raiding a bank and burning all the currency in its vaults. Elliptic, however, <a href="https://www.elliptic.co/blog/iranian-crypto-exchange-nobitex-hacked-pro-israel-group">noted</a> that dollar-backed stablecoins may be among the stolen crypto.</p>



<p>Stablecoins are different to other cryptocurrencies in that their value rests on something other than the forces of supply and demand – in Tether’s case, that is the dollar – and the companies that issue them own large stocks of real-world assets to protect the price peg. The strange consequence of this is that while America’s allies use stablecoins to escape the dollar financial system, they are in effect supporting that system by maintaining demand for U.S. Treasuries.</p>



<p><strong>ALL THAT GLITTERS IS CRYPTO</strong></p>



<p>They are not entirely happy about this, which is why they have been investing so heavily in the other great reserve asset: gold, the price of which has <a href="https://www.investmentweek.co.uk/news-analysis/4412882/gold-price-hits-record-highs-2025">hit</a> high after high after high this year. And this raises the fascinating prospect of a gold-backed stablecoin taking off, giving all the advantages of Tether but without having to <a href="https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/04/17/russian-officials-explore-stablecoin-alternatives-after-tether-wallet-blockade/">support</a> the U.S. government.</p>



<p>“The rise of gold-backed currencies that circumvent the US banking system, coupled with sanctioned regimes’ growing interest in the adoption of alternative currencies and payment systems, could create a massive blind spot for US financial intelligence and sanctions enforcement efforts,” <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/golds-geopolitical-comeback-how-physical-and-digital-gold-can-be-used-to-evade-us-sanctions/">argues</a> the Atlantic Council in an acute analysis. It suggests that Western countries should stop spraying sanctions around like they’re antibiotics on a pig farm, or such a future will come to pass sooner than anyone would think possible.</p>



<p>It's a warning that seems to be falling on deaf ears in Washington, where congresspeople are busy <a href="https://www.cfr.org/article/senates-new-ukraine-bill-will-not-work-here-how-fix-it">debating</a> ever-higher sanctions, and where businesspeople are busy riding the crypto wave. The latest deal is the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/crypto-group-tron-go-public-us-via-reverse-merger-with-srm-2025-06-16/">appearance</a> of Tron on Nasdaq via a reverse merger, which is good news for the company’s Chinese-born founder Justin Sun. As you may <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/28/business/crypto-mogul-trump-coins-civil-fraud-charges">remember</a>, a probe by US regulators into Sun’s activities was paused after he made a $75 million investment into the Trump family’s crypto firm World Liberty Financial last year.</p>





<p>This was not the only Trump dividend from the family partnership with Tron, a blockchain <a href="https://www.trmlabs.com/resources/blog/category-deep-dive-overall-2024-figures-and-declining-illicit-crypto-volume-on-tron">blamed</a> for 58 percent of all illicit activity in the crypto world, since two of the president’s sons in February <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-18/trump-linked-bank-helped-set-up-120-million-tron-deal-windfall">joined</a> the advisory board of the bank that <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zacheverson/2025/03/06/donald-trump-jr-eric-dominari-holdings-advisory-board-domh-stock/">organised</a> the reverse merger. On top of that, Tron has started <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/press-releases/usd1-stablecoin-begins-minting-on-tron">minting</a> the Trump family’s own stablecoin USD1, which will help increase the first family’s already <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-family-net-worth-crypto-investments/">large</a> crypto dividend.</p>



<p>In case you’re concerned that the business ties between Sun and the Trump family might lead to a conflict between the president’s personal and public interests, however, there is no need to be. “President Trump is dedicated to making America the crypto capital of the world,” White House spokesperson Anna Kelly has <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/28/crypto-trump-industry-memecoin-00372101">said</a>. “His assets are in a trust managed by his children, and there are no conflicts of interest.” &nbsp;I don’t remember everyone being quite so accepting that Hunter Biden’s business interests were separate to those of his father, but of course that was a very long time ago.<br></p>

<p>Coda’s ZEG storytelling <a href="https://www.zegfest.com/">festival</a> in Tbilisi has come to an end, and I am both overloaded with information and exhausted by drinking too much wine. My take-home message was that oligarchy is spreading ever wider, and that we need to take its threat to democracy far more seriously than anyone is doing at the moment.</p>



<p>I shared a stage with Ed Caesar, author and journalist from The New Yorker- magazine, who has written some great <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/06/01/house-of-secrets">pieces</a> on <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/deutsche-bank-mirror-trades-and-more-russian-threads">oligarchs</a> (as well as much else), with Paul Caruana Galizia, who made <a href="https://www.tortoisemedia.com/listen/londongrad">this </a>excellent podcast on Londongrad, and with Hans Gutbrod, whose <a href="https://hansgutbrod.substack.com/p/macbeth-of-the-caucasus-article-out">piece</a> on Georgia’s own Bidzina Ivanishvili is very much worth reading. And if you like surreal, ethereal documentaries, I highly recommend Salome Jashi’s ‘<a href="https://www.salomejashi.com/">Taming the Garden</a>’, which tackles oligarchy and its implications through the story of Georgian trees.&nbsp;</p>





<p>The joy of the festival is in the incidental meetings, of which few were more joyful for me than sitting next to Joseph Stiglitz at dinner and getting to hear his views on inequality, oligarchy, and the age of Trump. Where else would I ever get to do that?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moral of the story: you too should find time to come to Tbilisi next year for ZEG. If you do, you can also make a side-trip to the market to stock up on one of the world’s best <a href="https://roadsandkingdoms.com/2012/yet-another-sauce-of-glory/">condiments</a>.</p>



<p><strong>SHOW US THE MONEY</strong></p>



<p>Victoria Cleland, the Bank of England’s Chief Cashier, has announced that worried Brits are hoarding cash. “At a time of uncertainty, at a time of crisis people do move to cash. They want to make sure they have literally got something under the mattress,” she said at a <a href="https://cashintheuk.com/">conference</a> in London.</p>



<p>This, she said, helps to explain why the value of all the banknotes in circulation keeps going up – indeed, it hit a new all-time high of <a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/statistics/banknote">85.872 billion</a> pounds this year – despite the fact that people use less cash all the time. The Bank of England has previously estimated that between 20 and 24 percent of banknotes at any one time are being used in transactions, and the rest are unaccounted for (or, according to Cleland, hoarded).&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, if we do the sums and we accept Cleland’s logic, we can say that around 1,000 pounds worth of banknotes is being hoarded by every single person in the UK, up from around 920 pounds last year. I have to say that, with all due respect to Cleland, I am very dubious about that figure, not least because someone is getting a double share to make up for the fact that I don’t have even a fraction of that.</p>



<p>The most recent <a href="https://www.ukfinance.org.uk/system/files/2022-11/Watching%20our%20pennies%20-%20How%20consumers%20feel%20about%20cash.pdf">survey</a> I can find, which is from 2022, suggests I am not alone. The average Brit had just 113.82 pounds at home back then, and it’s hard to see why that total would have increased ninefold in the last three years.</p>



<p>This is not a UK-specific situation. The last survey conducted for the Federal Reserve shows that the average American had <a href="http://frbservices.org/binaries/content/assets/crsocms/news/research/2025-diary-of-consumer-payment-choice.pdf">$373</a> either in their wallet or at home in 2024, down $70 from the year before. So cash hoarding in the US is going down, but the value of banknotes in circulation keeps going up –&nbsp; indeed, it hit a new all-time high of <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CURRCIR">$2.835 trillion</a> in the most recent data release, which is around $7,000 for every person in the United States. So either Brits and Americans alike are spectacularly under-reporting how much cash they’re keeping at home, or someone else is using all that cash for something else.</p>



<p>Considering that barely a week goes by without news of major money laundering gangs being busted with bags full of banknotes, I personally would like it if central bank officials put a little bit of thought into asking whether the extremely healthy demand for their products is not in fact coming from organised criminals. And if it is, whether central banks ought to do something about that.</p>



<p>Five years ago, the House of Commons’ Public Accounts Committee scolded the Bank of England for not caring about where its banknotes go. “The Bank needs to get a better handle on the national currency it controls,” its chair, MP Meg Hillier, <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/127/public-accounts-committee/news/136880/pac-urges-bank-of-england-to-investigate-missing-50-billion-of-sterling-notes/">said</a>. It still does.</p>



<p><strong>TRACKING ‘ENDANGERED’ MILLIONAIRES</strong></p>



<p>Regular readers will know how much I admire the ability of <a href="https://www.henleyglobal.com/?page=ppc_Global_gsn_brand_brand_tier4_high-cost&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=22082599146&amp;gbraid=0AAAAACxMKa3phIY6EFWVp4AGBX2hpJrbj&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw9anCBhAWEiwAqBJ-c67-QXXz9LNTXh7wCh80cihr2nSN2uTtmeMXbMJHgkI8fi4vsRKGPRoCEo4QAvD_BwE">Henley &amp; Partners</a>, the world’s foremost passport vendor, to turn almost any piece of news into an advertisement for buying a new passport and/or visa.</p>



<p>In recent times, the alarm is being sounded by changes to British tax policy which, basically, make it more expensive for very rich people <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-32216346">to live</a> and <a href="https://www.taxadvisermagazine.com/article/scope-inheritance-tax-new-residence-based-system">to die</a> in the UK. And Henley responded in the way that it always does – “provisional estimates for 2024 are even more concerning, with a massive net outflow of 9,500 millionaires projected for this year alone,” it <a href="https://www.henleyglobal.com/publications/henley-private-wealth-migration-report-2024/londons-wealth-exodus">reported</a> last year about the “wealth exodus”. All was not lost, however. If only the UK would scrap taxes on capital gains and inheritance and privatise its healthcare system, millionaires might be persuaded to stay.</p>



<p>The ‘research’ was picked up very widely, with few media outlets questioning its methodology, its publisher’s motivations, how representative its purported database of 150,000 people was of the millions of millionaires in the world, or indeed how exactly anyone knows where they’re all going. The Tax Justice Network has now <a href="https://taxjustice.net/press/millionaire-exodus-did-not-occur-study-reveals/">delved</a> into the report, and its findings are worth a read, not least the headline conclusion that there was no exodus. The correct policy response, it argues, would therefore not be tax cuts at all but higher taxes on wealth.</p>



<p>So, what should we think? Are millionaires leaving the sinking ship, or are they clinging on to help rebuild? Should we lower taxes or raise them? The obvious solution is surely to use satellite tags so millionaires can be tracked like <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/graphics/tracking-the-great-serengeti-wildebeest-migration-feature">wildebeest</a> as they migrate from the watering holes of Chamonix to the rich, grazing pastures of Mayfair via the rutting grounds of St Barts. Only then can we know for sure if they’re being chased into extinction.</p>



<p><strong>CALLING OUT MONACO</strong></p>



<p>The European Union’s regularly <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_1378">updated</a> “list of high-risk jurisdictions presenting strategic deficiencies in their national anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) regimes” has done something worthwhile for the first time I can remember by singling out Monaco.</p>





<p>Normally, the list is made up of a random selection of irrelevant places and third-order tax havens. And there’s plenty of the usual on display: why anyone would worry that Côte d'Ivoire, Namibia and Nepal, for example, are supposedly big centres for financial crime, I have no idea. And normally, the list will avoid pointing a finger at any country that is closely allied or aligned with any EU member, which means the U.S. and U.K. never get singled out even though they’re clearly far more problematic than, say, Algeria.</p>



<p>This time, however, the list does single out Monaco. The principality is a major problem, with <a href="https://www.wsj.com/style/monaco-prince-albert-ii-scandal-49ac6b3f">deep ties</a> to deeply unsavoury people and a fast-developing financial scandal.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>There are two options for criminals in a democracy who don’t want to go to jail. The first is to launch a large-scale campaign to legalise whatever crime it is that you want to commit. This is hard, slow, laborious and, in most cases, impossible. The second is to not get caught. This is not necessarily easy either, but it’s a lot easier when law enforcement agencies are small, embattled and under-funded.</p>



<p>The 300,000 or so financial institutions subject to regulations in the United States have to report any suspicions they have about transactions, as well as reports of large cash payments, to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN. The idea is that their reports will alert investigators to crimes while they’re going on, and help the goodies catch the baddies.</p>



<p><strong>DEFUNDING THE COPS</strong></p>



<p>Sadly, however, FinCEN’s computer system is so clunky it’s like, as a former prosecutor once said, trying to plug AI into a Betamax. Investigators often have to create their own programmes to trawl a database that gains more than 25 million entries every year, or else just pick through them in the hope of finding something interesting. It effectively means that this vast and priceless resource is hardly ever used.</p>



<p>And now FinCEN’s budget looks like it will be slashed even further. “The pittance allocated to FinCEN in the current budget has been reduced even further,” <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/richards1_fincen-rest-in-peace-the-trump-administration-activity-7334761999123288065-TT6F/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAYMLHIBLdDSMghMVR1zAntZyFys_HmjnC0">wrote</a> compliance expert Jim Richards, with a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/appendix_fy2026.pdf">link</a> to the 1,200-page supplement to the White House’s proposed 2026 budget with details about the cut. The reduction would take <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/266/12.-FinCEN-FY-2025-CJ.pdf">spending</a> back to 2023 levels, which is worrying for anyone keen on seeing criminals stopped. And that’s even before you take into account the effect of workforce disillusionment at regulators such as the Securities and Exchange Commission, resulting from the cuts imposed by DOGE.</p>





<p>“I experienced some dark times during my SEC career, including the 2008-09 financial crisis and the Enron and Madoff scandals,” <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/trump-doge-sec-retirement-27ea213a?st=KBB2AS">wrote</a> Martin Kimel in a passionate column in Barron’s. “ But morale at the Commission is the worst I have ever seen, by far.&nbsp;No job is secure. Nobody knows what will become of the agency or its independence.” So, he added, “when the SEC offered early retirement and an incentive payment for people to voluntarily resign, I and hundreds of others reluctantly accepted.”</p>



<p>If you lose experienced personnel, and you lack the resources to invest in the latest technology, you will always lose ground against entrepreneurial and skilled financial criminals. That is the inevitable consequence of what is happening in the United States, which will be devastating for the victims of fraudsters, crooks, hackers and more.</p>



<p><strong>THE UK PRECEDENT</strong></p>



<p>There is, however, a cycle to this kind of thing. Governments that are determined to unleash the private sector always cut enforcement of regulations, but then they become embarrassed by the inevitable revelations of corruption, sleaze and incompetence that result. This is what happened in Britain, where years of news headlines about London being the favourite playground of oligarchs finally led to government action.</p>



<p>Three years ago, the British authorities imposed a special levy on financial institutions to fund the bodies that fight crime, and last month it <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/681dea86ced319d02c906075/ECL_Report_2023-24.pdf">published</a> a report on the first year of spending. More than 40 million pounds has been invested in new technology to tackle Suspicious Activity Reports (so no more Betamax in London), and almost 400 people have been hired to do the work, including some of them finally beginning to try to drain the swamp that is the U.K.’s corporate registry. This is good news.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is inevitable that, just like in the U.K., the United States will eventually become so appalled by the rampant criminality that will result from the cuts to FinCEN, the SEC and other bodies, that politicians will start building a decent system to stop it. I just wish everyone would get on with it, so millions of people don’t have to lose out first.</p>



<p><strong>THE EU GETS INTO GEAR?</strong></p>



<p>You can accuse the European Union of many things, but you can’t say that it acts hastily. Several months after the last progress update from the Anti-Money-Laundering Agency (AMLA), it has <a href="https://www.amla.europa.eu/media/press-release/amla-executive-board-members-appointed_en">appointed</a> its four permanent board members. They represent an interesting cross-section of European expertise.&nbsp;</p>





<p>There’s Simonas Krėpšta who, at the Bank of Lithuania, has overseen the country’s <a href="https://nordicfintechmagazine.com/potential-and-will-lithuanias-strategy-for-fintech-growth-simonas-krepsta-bank-of-lithuania/">booming </a>fintech sector and, therefore, has a good insight into the country’s booming money laundering sector, which has seen quite a lot of firms get <a href="https://tech.eu/2025/04/08/revolut-slapped-with-3-5m-fine-by-lithuania-s-central-bank-over-money-laundering-prevention-failings/">fined</a>, including arguably Europe’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/06/europes-most-valuable-fintech-and-which-startups-became-unicorns-this-year/">most valuable</a> startup Revolut.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Then there’s Derville Rowland of the Central Bank of Ireland, who will bring inside knowledge of Europe’s most aggressive <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/ireland-edges-into-top-10-global-tax-haven-ranking-2024-10-01/">tax haven</a>. And Rikke-Louise Ørum Petersen, who joined Denmark’s Financial Supervisory Authority in 2015, just when the <a href="https://www.thecorporategovernanceinstitute.com/insights/news-analysis/scandal-at-danske-a-striking-saga-of-lousy-governance/?srsltid=AfmBOorCh6Akvd5M4qxxUBrTVx23JrCTMf8bW19TPeyj-NWvW9eBU_QE">money laundering</a> spree by Danske Bank was about to explode into public view. Finally, there’s Juan Manuel Vega Serrano, who was previously head of the Financial Action Task Force, which gives him plenty of experience of working at an ineffective, slow-moving, superficially apolitical, supranational anti-money laundering organisation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All told, I’d say this is a pretty perfect group of people for the job. The European Union works slowly, but it works thoroughly. Of course, AMLA won’t actually be doing anything <a href="https://www.amla.europa.eu/faqs_en">until 2028</a>, and it probably won’t do much after that either. But you can’t have everything.<br></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Corporate Transparency Act was <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/2513/text">passed</a> by Congress at the very end of Donald Trump’s first term, with bipartisan support and an important mission to protect national security, expose wrongdoing and complicate the committing of financial crime by forcing companies to declare the names of their owners.&nbsp;</p>





<p>This was at the time not a controversial piece of legislation, not least because American politicians – as part of the Financial Action Task Force – have been <a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/topics/fatf-recommendations.html">pressuring</a> other countries to pass similar laws since the late twentieth century. But it has proved messy to implement. FinCEN, the United States’ financial crimes enforcement network, only finished making the necessary rules to file what it calls “beneficial ownership information” last year – just in time for judges in Alabama and Texas to <a href="https://www.mayerbrown.com/en/insights/resource-centers/corporate-transparency-act-resources">declare</a> them illegal, and then for the second Trump administration to basically ditch them altogether by saying they don’t apply to 99.9 percent of corporations that are registered in the U.S.</p>



<p>The consultation period over this decision to ditch the filing requirement is now over. (So, if you feel strongly but didn’t get round to writing in, I’m sorry to say you’ve missed your chance.) It is now possible to browse through the several-dozen submissions from concerned citizens and organisations, which is an enlightening experience.</p>



<p><strong>MAKING COMPANIES OPAQUE AGAIN</strong></p>



<p>In the pro-rules camp, you can find comments from law enforcement agencies, anti-corruption organisations, environmental campaigners, credit unions and others who are concerned that the Trump administration’s decision to maintain the previous lax standards is damaging and unwise.</p>



<p>“Without this data,” <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/comment/FINCEN-2025-0001-0003">stated</a> the National District Attorneys’ Association, in a fairly typical submission, “prosecutors are left blind when investigating shell companies used by fentanyl and human traffickers, cybercriminals, and corrupt foreign actors.” These, they added, “are not abstract concerns –these are real threats to American families and communities.”</p>



<p>In the other camp are the small business owners, or associations representing them, who are delighted that the requirements to file their details with FinCEN are now history, and want all beneficial ownership information already filed to be deleted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“For many of us, the original BOI requirements felt like an unfair assumption of guilt, treating hard working entrepreneurs as potential criminals rather than the backbone of our economy,” <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/comment/FINCEN-2025-0001-0008">wrote</a> Stephen McKissen, the owner of a video production company in Denver, Colorado. Removing the requirement, he argued, “for US companies and US persons to report BOI lifts a significant weight off our shoulders.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ever since the world’s first piece of anti-money laundering legislation was <a href="https://www.fincen.gov/resources/statutes-and-regulations/bank-secrecy-act">passed</a> in 1970, businesses have complained about the compliance burdens it imposed upon them. Criminals hide by pretending to be legitimate businesspeople, and the only way they can be exposed is by imposing rules on everyone, thus obliging honest folk to undergo paperwork and inconvenience, which is not popular with the honest folk (or, I suppose, the dishonest ones).</p>



<p>It's crucial to the way the legislation is implemented therefore to minimise that inconvenience, to make sure it does not cause so much irritation that it becomes a political issue. This appears to be where the U.S. efforts ran aground. I had a look at the FinCEN <a href="https://boiefiling.fincen.gov/boir/html">portal</a> through which company ownership is registered and which the small businesses were complaining about. It didn’t look too bad to me, but if the registration process is anything like the comment-reading process, I can see why people are annoyed about having to do it.</p>



<p>Every single comment on the proposed rule changes has the <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/document/FINCEN-2025-0001-0001/comment?postedDateFrom=2025-05-27&amp;postedDateTo=2025-05-29&amp;sortBy=postedDate&amp;sortDirection=desc">same headline</a>, so it’s impossible to tell which are <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/comment/FINCEN-2025-0001-0100">interesting</a> and which are utterly <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/comment/FINCEN-2025-0001-0002">banal</a>, without opening a new page, then opening a new attachment. When you return to the main page, the list of them rearranges itself unexpectedly, so it’s hard to know which ones you’ve already read. It is in short a very poorly designed piece of software, and you’d think a country that created Google, Apple, Facebook and the rest might have been able to find some better programmers.</p>



<p>Back, though, to America’s notoriously lax shell company <a href="https://gfintegrity.org/report/the-library-card-project/">legislation</a>. It is the result of it being devolved to state level, so that some states – Delaware and Nevada are stand-out examples – end up competing with each other to attract more incorporation, thus sparking a race to the bottom.&nbsp;</p>





<p>Perhaps there’s nothing that could have been done to make American business owners appreciate the need to file information about beneficial ownership, but the lesson for bureaucrats is that you have to make compliance easy. Having to file information at both state and federal level was never going to be popular, particularly if the web portal involved was also clunky and annoying.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, what’s left of the Corporate Transparency Act will nicely align with the White House’s wider agenda, since it now <a href="https://www.fincen.gov/boi-faqs">only applies</a> to foreign companies that have registered to do business in the United States. If criminals currently using offshore-incorporated corporations want to avoid having to report their identity to the authorities, they’ll now need to <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/comment/FINCEN-2025-0001-0101">set up</a> a domestic shell company, which will I suppose be a small win for USA Inc.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s too early to say whether Trump’s tariffs and threats will bring businesses and manufacturing back to America, but he is at least making onshore shell companies great again.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>At our annual festival, 800 people, including 120 speakers from around the world, will gather to experiment with stories, challenge conventions, and build a new kind of community</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The girl in the black Audrey Hepburn dress was crying in the bathroom, mascara running down her cheeks. We found her by chance—a total stranger using the bathroom of a hotel where we were hosting a giant dinner party for our 200 guests. My ZEG co-founders and I, on a quick trip away from our sprawling table, gathered around her, wanting to understand what had happened. Through tears, she told us her boyfriend had just broken up with her and announced he was getting engaged to someone else. On her birthday.</p>





<p>We handed her tissues and then invited her to join our party. Ten minutes later, she was surrounded by journalists, artists, Nobel laureates, filmmakers, and activists, all raising glasses and toasting her birthday as if she were the guest of honor. By the end of the night, she was laughing, swept up in the improbable magic that happens when you throw open the doors and bring strangers together.</p>



<p>As we organize the fifth edition of our storytelling festival, I keep thinking back to that night last summer. Of all the remarkable moments we've witnessed at ZEG, our annual storytelling festival, of all the celebrities and headliners we've hosted, it's that spontaneous encounter that best embodies the spirit of what we're trying to build: a place where boundaries dissolve, where the unexpected is welcome, and where someone who walked in crying can leave feeling part of a community they never knew existed.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.codastory.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/supra-1800x1200.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-56815"/></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How ZEG came to be</strong></h2>



<p>I'll be honest: I never thought I believed in ‘events’ as a way to do journalism. When I was reporting from war zones for the BBC, I believed journalism's impact was measured in stories published and scoops landed and in being on the ground.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, that remains true. But with social media platforms shaping how stories are distributed and consumed, I saw that journalism's survival hinged on our ability to create spaces for meaningful engagement and collective understanding. For our team at Coda, events like ZEG are not a side project—they’re central to how we create meaning and context in a noisy world. They let us go beyond the article, beyond the headline, and to wrestle as a community with the “how” and “why” and, sometimes, to change the story altogether, or at least our understanding of it.</p>



<p>That's the philosophy behind ZEG. But in practice, with colleagues scattered from San Francisco to Tbilisi, London, New York, Milan, and Delhi, the festival is put together in a whirlwind of Slack threads, late-night WhatsApps, and video calls that span time zones. Sometimes I look at the Zoom screen and can't help but chuckle: one of us is in a taxi after covering a protest, another is dialing in from an airport, someone else is squeezing in the call between deadlines or giving a bath to one of the kids. Though we never planned it this way, everyone on the screen is a woman, each of us juggling her own corner of chaos as we plan our biggest event of the year.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img src="https://www.codastory.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/zeg-clouds.png" alt="" class="wp-image-56818"/></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A laboratory for journalism</strong></h2>



<p>The word “zeg" means "the day after tomorrow” in Georgian. And that encapsulates Coda's mission to look beyond the headlines, connect the dots between crises, identify emerging patterns, and to stay on the story by building sustained narratives in a world that is fragmented, distracted and quick to forget. We know that keeping a critical eye on the present provides insights into the future. It’s why we aim to pioneer new ways to tell stories about the world, to show how local realities are part of wider global conversations that resonate across borders and generations.</p>



<p>ZEG began as a collaboration, a leap of faith between journalists and entrepreneurs in my hometown Tbilisi. We were brought together by the belief that stories can change not just what we know, but how we see and what we do. We wondered, in that first year, if anyone would really fly across the world to Georgia for a festival about telling stories, and how to tell them better. But people did, and—with the exception of the COVID years—they've kept coming ever since.</p>



<p>What started as an experiment has become an international event. In 2025, we’ll host 800 people, including 120 speakers, over three packed days.</p>



<p>Every year, friends ask me: “Who’s your big star at ZEG this time?” I’m never quite sure how to answer. The real magic is in the mix: in the way hundreds of people from all over the world come together, crossing borders both physical and mental, for three days of conversations that bend minds and spark connections that last a lifetime.</p>



<p>If you’re looking for a festival that’s the opposite of formulaic, you’ll find it at ZEG. We don’t have themes; we want space for surprises, to see where the questions we ask take us, and to try to arrive at ideas and perspectives that are fresh.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.codastory.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/zeg-2-1800x900.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-56817"/></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Beyond the festival</strong></h2>



<p>What happens at ZEG doesn't stay at ZEG. We carry on its spirit of inquiry in Coda’s journalism. Our mission is to stay on the story, so that the conversations and connections that begin at the festival invigorate and inform our reporting and coverage long after the festival lights go down.</p>



<p>While we know that for most of you, Tbilisi is a long way to come, we believe there's something essential about having global conversations far from the center. ZEG was born on the periphery, and—as we've seen again and again—it’s from the margins that the most original ideas and most urgent questions often emerge.</p>



<p>These are ideas and questions we want as many people as possible to hear and to interrogate. So we’re also working to make ZEG a year-round series of events both in person and online. This year, we're piloting "mini ZEGs" beyond the shores of Georgia for the first time, with events already being planned in Amsterdam, London, and on the East Coast of the United States.</p>

<p>I’ve been thinking a lot about the <a href="https://thebulletin.org/doomsday-clock/?gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=22511748454&amp;gbraid=0AAAAAC3qOh-CWMLf_SUpS1Q737T3PvE-q&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwlrvBBhDnARIsAHEQgOQOkKsKg2M9Rpp0vj2gLZ8mbogU3OuTV2ptIuEQlnCm4Yw2fVaLY7oaAgk2EALw_wcB#nav_menu">apocalypse</a> in the last few days, and wondering what options oligarchs believe are available to help them escape it. In Mark Lynas’s <a href="https://marklynas.org/books/six-minutes-to-winter-nuclear-war-and-how-to-avoid-it/">new book</a> about atomic weapons, he helpfully provides a table showing what percentage of each country’s population would die during or immediately after a nuclear war. The sheer number of places that have 100 or a number in the high 90s in the right-hand column is a bit bleak, but if you think like an enabler you can see opportunity.</p>





<p>New Zealand is often touted as the go-to destination for riding out the apocalypse. Vivos has apparently <a href="https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/billionaire-boltholes-inside-doomsday-hideouts-170000871.html?guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAGp6IBd-ZxgPYxNhuXwgIzh5YWwVuZqWQnKJuO5FFY9mmDfaWL80wCA_KveahoSL2wxlNvUMB9T_GzBuZPfrlnsnxBY-_fucMY9f1FsmEQMIZCM0IFs0Lc3rt_RgE6C-OSn_NiLZ2IlGhe9STuO5cML6Vn1hX4mtV2E1nFURHscp&amp;guccounter=2">built</a> a 300-place luxury bunker on the South Island, and Rising S Bunkers, an American company that specializes in the building of doomsday shelters, have been busy too. Peter Thiel <a href="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/indepth/national/how-peter-thiel-got-new-zealand-citizenship/">obtained</a> New Zealand citizenship, though tragically was not able to build his own mega-bunker after he failed to get planning permission. But that has not stopped other billionaires from <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/billionaires-are-building-luxury-bunkers-to-escape-doomsday/">planning</a> their escapes to the land of the long white cloud.</p>



<p><strong>BILLIONAIRE BOLTHOLES</strong></p>



<p>Politicians in Wellington are only too happy to help. In April, they eased up on the rules around the country’s golden visa programme to attract more of this sweet flight capital, removing a requirement that applicants speak English, and reducing the cost. You now only need to spend 21 days in the country to establish residency, down from three years, which is good news for tech barons keen not to have to pay tax or make friends or stuff like that.</p>



<p>“In the past, the vast majority of applicants were looking for tax havens,” former immigrant minister Stuart Nash <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/9fd850ae-41da-4547-9414-3e7f11f4c9de">told</a> the FT. “Now they’re looking for safe havens.” Nash is a man for the snappy catch phrase. Since leaving government, he has set up Nash Kelly Global, a relocation company, which has the distinctly yuk for an ex-politician but very on-brand <a href="https://www.nashkellyglobal.com/">tagline</a>: ‘What they don’t tell you about New Zealand. It’s not what you know. It’s who you know.’</p>



<p>But I’m afraid New Zealand is not quite the safe option it’s been cracked up to be. For a start, how safe is New Zealand? Lynas’ deaths table shows that in the event of war, 68 percent of New Zealanders would be dead after two years of nuclear winter. Okay, that’s better than Russia (98 percent), the United States, China, the United Kingdom, Canada, France, Germany (99 percent) or Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates (100 percent), but it’s still not great. And expensive fortifications wouldn’t help: billionaires would not be able to hide forever from gangs of survivors and would be, Lynas writes, “winkled out of their bunkers and hiding places like fat grubs”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, which countries do offer the best survival prospects in the event of Trump or Putin getting an itchy trigger finger? Iceland, Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, Costa Rica, Haiti and – painfully no doubt for Kiwis – Australia all have a 0 percent death rate. At present, Iceland does not sell visas, and Australia <a href="https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/getting-a-visa/visa-listing/business-innovation-and-investment-188/significant-investor-stream">closed</a> its investor visa programme last year, so it’s no good to you even if you have the cash to flash. But there are plenty of options among the others: Uruguay’s is a bit pricey, but Costa Rica will <a href="https://www.henleyglobal.com/residence-investment/costa-rica">sell</a> you residency for just $150,000, and Argentina is practically <a href="https://goldenharbors.com/articles/argentina-investment-visa">giving</a> it away.</p>



<p>I’m surprised no one’s started marketing these countries to rich people worried about nuclear war: ‘If life sends you nuclear winter, enjoy the fresh powder.’ Mr Nash, you can have that one for free.</p>



<p><strong>ESCAPE TO MARS</strong></p>



<p>Of course, everywhere on Earth is going to be impacted a bit by nuclear war, so why not abandon our planet altogether? Elon Musk’s current plan is for a first unmanned mission to take off for Mars next year, with people due to land on the red planet in 2028, and for a self-sustaining colony to exist within 20 years.</p>



<p>SpaceX has released a handy new video <a href="https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x9jp6hi">simulation</a> of the journey, though I hope for the Muskonauts’ sake that they won’t have to listen to that dreadful music for the entire eight-month trip. If I was as rich as Musk, I’d have licensed Queen’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgzGwKwLmgM">‘Don’t Stop Me Now’</a> at least. The upside to living on Mars of course is that you wouldn’t be on a planet that could be rendered uninhabitable by a nuclear bomb. The downside though would be that you’d be on a planet that’s already uninhabitable. So, perhaps it would be better to focus on securing the future of Earth instead?&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Surely the best way to protect the human species in coming decades is to focus on resolving the tensions we face at home, from unbridled nuclear proliferation to strategic global competition and realignment,” <a href="https://quillette.com/2025/05/19/the-mars-vanity-project/">wrote </a>noted physicist Lawrence Krauss.</p>





<p>Predictably enough, Musk dismissed Strauss’ argument by <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1924291880721772850?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1924291880721772850%7Ctwgr%5E67b35d4e8e5fb1f6b32d266e6840d05859e6b779%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fin.mashable.com%2Fscience%2F94348%2Felon-musk-clashes-with-astrophysicist-who-says-mars-cannot-be-occupied">tagging</a> @IfindRetards in reply (such a <em>hilarious</em> guy!). But Strauss raises an interesting point. Cold War-era treaties, <a href="https://www.unoosa.org/oosa/en/ourwork/spacelaw/treaties/introouterspacetreaty.html">negotiated</a> to prevent an extraterrestrial arms race, declare that there is no sovereign territory or territorial appropriation in space. Yet, according to Starlink’s <a href="https://www.starlink.com/legal/documents/DOC-1020-91087-64">terms of service</a>, Mars is “a free planet”, and no Earth-based powers have authority there: “Disputes will be settled through self-governing principles, established in good faith, at the time of Martian settlement.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>That looks a lot like Musk is claiming the right to govern Mars as its settlers see fit. Of course, it’s not impossible that the new settlers (who will have been chosen by Musk, trained by Musk, brought to Mars by Musk’s rocket, and who will be entirely dependent on Musk for future resupply) might set up a genuinely democratic system of self-government. But it’s also possible that Musk might want to claim Mars for himself. That would be in violation of Earth’s treaties, and therefore bad. It would also – considering the havoc wreaked by Musk in his brief stint in government – be a pretty grim prospect on its own terms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, you don’t need to go to Mars to set up your own government. Right here on earth we have <a href="https://www.seasteading.org/eleutheria-podcast/">Eleutheria</a>, which is now aiming to negotiate a 99-year lease for a bit of Tuvalu to build a “free private city”, having given up on the idea of building a state in a Bir Tawil, an isolated, unclaimed bit of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/03/welcome-to-the-land-that-no-country-wants-bir-tawil">desert</a> between Egypt and Sudan. It is indeed easier to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/zizek/comments/w0u7ca/who_actually_said_its_easier_to_imagine_the_end/">imagine</a> the end of the world than the end of capitalism.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Last week, Donald Trump was on a glitzy, bonhomous trip through Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. Amidst the talk of hundreds of billions of dollars signed in deals, the rise of Gulf states as potential AI superpowers, and gifts of luxury jetliners, it was announced that the Trump administration had agreed arms deals worth over $3 billion with both Qatar and the UAE.</p>



<p>Democrats are looking to block the deals. Apart from the potential corruption alleged by legislators – the many personal deals the president also inked while on his trip – they criticized the sale of weapons to the UAE at a time when it was prolonging a civil war in Sudan that the U.N. has <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/04/1162096">described</a> as “one of the worst humanitarian crises of the 21st century.”</p>





<p>Earlier this month, a Sudanese politician <a href="https://sudantribune.com/article300848/">said</a> Trump’s trip to the Gulf was a “rare opportunity” to make a decisive intervention in a war that is now into its third year. In 2023, the U.S., Saudi Arabia, Sudan’s army and the rebels signed a peace treaty in Jeddah. It lasted a day. Despite the involvement of both Saudi Arabia and the UAE in the conflict – Sudan has accused the UAE of being directly responsible for the May 4 drone attacks on the city of Port Sudan – there was no mention of it during Trump’s visit.</p>



<p>Since April 2023, Sudan has been convulsed by civil war. The fighting – between the Sudanese army and the RSF rebel forces, primarily comprising Janjaweed militias that fought on the side of the army in the Darfur conflict back in 2003 – has cost thousands of lives and displaced over 12 million people. Tens of millions are starving.</p>



<p>In May, the fighting intensified. But on Monday, Sudan’s army chief, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/19/sudans-army-leader-al-burhan-appoints-former-un-official-as-prime-minister">announced</a> the appointment of a new prime minister&nbsp; – career diplomat Kamal Idris. The African Union <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/5/19/sudans-army-leader-al-burhan-appoints-former-un-official-as-prime-minister">said</a> Idris’s appointment was a “step towards inclusive governance.” But there is little sign of the fighting stopping. In fact, Port Sudan, where much of the humanitarian aid entered into the country, was targeted in drone attacks this month, forcing the U.N. to suspend deliveries. The Sudanese army has said renewed fighting with the RSF will force it to shut down critical infrastructure that its neighbor South Sudan needs to export its oil. South Sudan’s economy is almost wholly dependent on oil. The threat of economic collapse might force South Sudan, which became independent in 2011, to join in the Sudanese civil war.&nbsp;</p>





<p>This week, the Trump administration was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/20/trump-administration-deported-migrants-south-sudan">accused </a>of “illegally” dispatching migrants to South Sudan. A judge said such an action might constitute contempt, but the Department of Homeland Security claimed the men were a threat to public safety. “No country on Earth wanted to accept them,” a spokesperson <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5311706-trump-administration-deports-migrants/">said</a>, “because their crimes are so uniquely monstrous and barbaric.” The Trump administration’s extraordinary decision to deport migrants to South Sudan, a country on the verge of violent collapse and neighboring a country mired in civil war, is in keeping with his attitude towards the region. The decision, for instance, to shut down USAID only <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy7x87ev5jyo">exacerbated</a> the food crisis in Sudan, with soup kitchens closing and a loss of 44% of the aid funding to the country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With Trump fitfully engaging in all manner of peace talks, from Gaza to Kyiv to Kashmir, why is Sudan being ignored? Given the transactional nature of Trump’s diplomacy, is it because Sudan has nothing Trump wants? In April, for instance, the Trump administration <a href="https://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/congo-us-rwanda-mineral-deal/">attempted</a> to broker peace between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda in Washington, offering security in exchange for minerals. In this colonial carving up of resources, perhaps Trump is content to let his friends in the UAE <a href="https://www.rfi.fr/en/africa/20250330-sudan-booming-wartime-gold-trade-flows-through-the-uae">control</a> Sudan’s gold mines and ignore a civil war he might otherwise try to stop.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Since Donald Trump returned to the White House in January, some <a href="https://www.tigta.gov/sites/default/files/reports/2025-05/2025ier017fr.pdf">31 percent</a> of “revenue agents” (the people tasked with conducting tax audits) have lost their jobs. This is supposed to save the government money, but it’s a bit like trying to reduce the cost of crime by sacking police officers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This administration is clearly running the risk of losing hundreds of billions of dollars -- in fact, likely over&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-22/summers-says-attack-on-irs-may-risk-a-1-trillion-revenue-hit?embedded-checkout=true">$1 trillion</a> -- through its destruction of the IRS. “At a time when deficits are high and rising, that seems a baffling policy choice,” <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/the-fiscal-impact-of-irs-staffing-cuts/">said</a> Larry Summers, noted economist, former treasury secretary, and former president of Harvard University.</p>



<p>The policy is indeed baffling if its aim is to collect taxes; it’s not baffling at all, though, if the intention is to help rich people dodge them.</p>

<p>An early announcement from Trump’s Department of Justice was to <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/pausing-foreign-corrupt-practices-act-enforcement-to-further-american-economic-and-national-security/">pause</a> enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which has been central to global efforts against bribery since the 1970s. Trump has long argued that prosecuting American businesses for bribing foreign officials makes it harder for U.S. companies to compete. A new DoJ <a href="https://www.justice.gov/criminal/media/1400046/dl?inline">memo</a> shows that it has now thought about what it wants to do, and how to do it in a way that prioritises American interests.</p>



<p>There have long been suspicions that U.S. authorities reserve their biggest fines for non-US companies (a French bank getting <a href="https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/bnp-paribas-agrees-plead-guilty-and-pay-89-billion-illegally-processing-financial">fined</a> almost $9 billion, for example), and suggesting that prosecutions will be “America first” is unlikely to help with that perception. “Enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA") will now be focused on conduct that harms U.S. interests and affects the competitiveness of U.S. businesses, further suggesting that future FCPA enforcement will be focused on non-U.S. companies,” noted lawyers from White&amp;Case in this<a href="https://www.whitecase.com/insight-alert/ten-takeaways-doj-criminal-divisions-new-playbook-white-collar-enforcement-priorities"> assessment</a>.</p>



<p>There is already widespread global concern that the Trump administration will exploit the U.S. dollar’s dominant position in finance to force foreigners to do what it wants. Suggestions that corruption laws are not equally enforced will only further that suspicion. The fewer foreigners who rely on dollars, the less impact US sanctions will have, so it would be good if officials would consider that before implementing their policies.</p>



<p><strong>MINDING THE TAX GAP</strong></p>



<p>Readers old enough to remember the financial crisis of 2007-8 will also remember the wave of popular anger against tax-dodgers that followed it. American prosecutors <a href="https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/ubs-enters-deferred-prosecution-agreement">investigated</a> Swiss <a href="https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/credit-suisse-pleads-guilty-conspiracy-aid-and-assist-us-taxpayers-filing-false-returns">banks</a> (good times!); protesters <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/starbucks-tax-row-protestors-occupy-stores-10461421#:~:text=One%20store%20in%20Vigo%20Street,the%20gaze%20of%20the%20police.">occupied</a> branches of Starbucks (fun!); almost all countries agreed to <a href="https://www.oecd.org/content/dam/oecd/en/publications/reports/2017/03/standard-for-automatic-exchange-of-financial-account-information-in-tax-matters-second-edition_g1g73eb6/9789264267992-en.pdf">exchange</a> information with each other about their citizens’ tax affairs to uncover cheats (massive!).</p>



<p>According to the EU Tax Observatory, this information exchange has been a triumph, and cut wealthy people’s <a href="https://www.taxobservatory.eu/publication/global-tax-evasion-report-2024/">misuse</a> of offshore trickery by two-thirds. I have always been a little suspicious of these declarations of victory, however, despite them coming from such a good source, and find grounds for my doubts in this new <a href="https://www.nao.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/collecting-the-right-tax-from-wealthy-individuals.pdf">report</a> from the UK’s National Audit Office.</p>



<p>British tax authorities every year <a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/an-introduction-to-the-uk-tax-gap/">estimate</a> a tax gap – the difference between what the country’s exchequer should receive, and what it actually gets – and politicians regularly talk about <a href="https://labour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Labours-Plan-to-Close-the-Tax-Gap.pdf">reducing </a>it. If the Trump administration seems uninterested in clamping down on tax evasion, and financial chicanery in general, the British government has pledged additional resources for technology and investigators to try to understand what’s happening and whether its tax gap estimate is close to being accurate, so we may learn more about this in future years. Fingers crossed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the NAO report suggests that the way it’s calculated may be a bit questionable. According to the standard estimate, wealthy individuals pay around 1.9 billion pounds less than they should. But, according to a different estimate (“<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hmrc-annual-report-and-accounts-2023-to-2024-technical-notes/hmrc-compliance-yield-technical-note">compliance yield</a>”), the tax authorities have successfully brought in an extra 3 billion pounds from wealthy people that would not have been collected without their efforts.</p>



<p>It is a little hard to understand how it is possible to increase tax compliance by 1.1 billion more pounds than the entire deficit that wealthy people are supposedly underpaying. It’s like losing two pounds down the back of an armchair, reaching beneath the cushion and finding three. Except with billions. Something else is very definitely going on. “The&nbsp;large increase in compliance&nbsp;yield&nbsp;raises the possibility that underlying levels of non-compliance among the wealthy population were much greater than previously thought,” notes the NAO.</p>





<p>I am, I admit, someone who fixates on offshore skulduggery, but I can’t help noticing the report states that a mere five percent of the UK tax authorities’ investigative efforts were looking into “offshore non-compliance”. Tax advisers are clever, well-paid people, and they’ll know very well about the best places to hide their clients’ money, and there’s even a suggestion for them in the report: if your client holds wealth in properties abroad, or owns shares in her own name rather than through an institution, her home government will never know about her income she earns from them. Happy days.</p>

<p>And speaking of offshore skullduggery. The city of Mariupol has long been central to the war in Ukraine. Enveloped early by Russian forces, its defenders held out for <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-61529877">months</a> in an epic battle in the ruins of the Azovstal steel plant, before surrendering in May 2022. Moscow has since made it the poster city for the supposedly prosperous future available in a Russia-ruled Ukraine, but a new <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/63e4aef3ae07ad445eed03b5/t/6821a88164412a626e3e204e/1747036293628/SOCACE-RP35-LootingMariupol_final.pdf">report</a> makes clear how hollow such claims are.</p>



<p>“Powerful Moscow-based networks are controlling much of the reconstruction programme. Well-connected companies are benefiting from Russian spending that involves the widespread use of illicit finance and corrupt practices,” note its authors, David Lewis and Olivia Allison. They have specific policy recommendations, of which I think the most important ones relate to my old bugbear of sanctions, which should be better targeted and more strategically deployed. Russia’s crimes in Ukraine include the looting and economic exploitation of cities like Mariupol.&nbsp;<br></p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Like his predecessor, Pope Leo XIV is a wise, cautionary voice against the embrace of tech at the expense of human beings</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>As Rome prepared to select a new pope, few beyond Vatican insiders were focused on what the transition would mean for the Catholic Church's stance on artificial intelligence.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yet Pope Francis has established the Church as an erudite, insightful voice on AI ethics. "Does it serve to satisfy the needs of humanity to improve the well-being and integral development of people?”” he asked G7 leaders last year, “Or does it, rather, serve to enrich and increase the already high power of the few technological giants despite the dangers to humanity?"</p>





<p>Francis – and the Vatican at large – had called for meaningful regulation in a world where few institutions dared challenge the tech giants.</p>



<p>During the last months of Francis’s papacy, Silicon Valley, aided by a pliant U.S. government, has ramped up its drive to rapidly consolidate power.</p>



<p>OpenAI is expanding globally, tech CEOs are<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/13/american-business-titans-trump-saudi-arabia-00346653"> becoming</a> a key component of presidential diplomatic missions, and federal U.S. lawmakers are attempting to effectively <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/republicans-regulation-ai-next-ten-years-2071929">deregulate</a> AI for the next decade.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For those tracking the collision between technological and religious power, one question looms large: Will the Vatican continue to be one of the few global institutions willing to question Silicon Valley's vision of our collective future?</p>



<p>Memories of watching the chimney on television during Pope Benedict’s election had captured my imagination as a child brought up in a secular, Jewish-inflected household. I longed to see that white smoke in person.&nbsp; The rumors in Rome last Thursday morning were that the matter wouldn’t be settled that day. So I was furious when I was stirred from my desk in the afternoon by the sound of pealing bells all over Rome. “Habemus papam!” I heard an old nonna call down to her husband in the courtyard.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As I heard the bells of Rome hailing a new pope toll last Thursday I sprinted out onto the street and joined people streaming from all over the city in the direction of St. Peter’s. In recent years, the time between white smoke and the new pope’s arrival on the balcony was as little as forty-five minutes. People poured over bridges and up the Via della Conciliazione towards the famous square. Among the rabble I spotted a couple of friars darting through the crowd, making speedier progress than anyone, their white cassocks flapping in the wind. Together, the friars and I made it through the security checkpoints and out into the square just as a great roar went up.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The initial reaction to the announcement that Robert Francis Prevost would be the next pope, with the name Leo XIV, was subdued. Most people around me hadn’t heard of him — he wasn’t one of the favored cardinals, he wasn’t Italian, and we couldn’t even Google him, because there were so many people gathered that no one’s phones were working. A young boy managed to get on the phone to his mamma, and she related the information about Prevost to us via her son. Americano, she said. From Chicago.</p>



<p>A nun from an order in Tennessee piped up that she had met Prevost once. She told us that he was mild-mannered and kind, that he had lived in Peru, and that he was very internationally-minded. “The point is, it’s a powerful American voice in the world, who isn’t Trump,” one American couple exclaimed to our little corner of the crowd.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It only took a few hours before Trump supporters, led by former altar boy Steve Bannon, realized this American pope wouldn’t be a MAGA pope. Leo XIV had posted on X in February, criticizing JD Vance, the Trump administration’s most prominent Catholic.</p>



<p>"I mean it's kind of jaw-dropping," Bannon <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyglw20lg2o">told</a> the BBC. "It is shocking to me that a guy could be selected to be the Pope that had had the Twitter feed and the statements he's had against American senior politicians."</p>



<p>Laura Loomer, a prominent far-right pro-Trump activist <a href="https://x.com/LauraLoomer/status/1920537118041854297">aired</a> her own misgivings on X: “He is anti-Trump, anti-MAGA, pro-open borders, and a total Marxist like Pope Francis.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>As I walked home with everybody else that night – with the friars, the nuns, the pilgrims, the Romans, the tourists caught up in the action – I found myself thinking about our <a href="https://www.audible.com/search?searchNarrator=Christopher+Wylie&amp;ref_pageloadid=J06yHclGbh1Idv9o&amp;pf_rd_p=e65d6a64-c458-4fdf-a64b-10d86bbb52fe&amp;pf_rd_r=K2XYVBQH13XY5GAN6AXM&amp;plink=B0nawasjvfBRo8ah&amp;pageLoadId=r3Y1XJWE41YRIkE9&amp;creativeId=16015ba4-2e2d-4ae3-93c5-e937781a25cd&amp;ref=a_pd_Captur_pin_narrator_1">"Captured" podcast series</a>, which I've spent the past year working on. In our investigation of AI's growing influence, we documented how tech leaders have created something akin to a new religion, with its own prophets, disciples, and promised salvation.</p>



<p>Walking through Rome's ancient streets, the dichotomy struck me: here was the oldest continuous institution on earth selecting its leader, while Silicon Valley was rapidly establishing what amounts to a competing belief system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Would this new pope, taking the name of Leo — deliberately evoking Leo XIII who steered the church through the disruptions of the Industrial Revolution — stand against this present-day technological transformation that threatens to reshape what it means to be human?</p>





<p>I didn't have to wait long to find out. In his address to the College of Cardinals on Saturday, Pope Leo XIV<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/may/09/pope-leo-xiv-to-hold-first-mass-pontiff-catholics-celebrate-live"> </a><a href="https://in.mashable.com/life/94057/new-pope-leo-xiv-cites-ais-challenge-to-human-dignity-in-his-name-choice">said</a>: "In our own day, the Church offers to everyone the treasury of her social teaching, in response to another industrial revolution and to developments in the field of artificial intelligence that pose new challenges for the defence of human dignity, justice and labor."</p>



<p>&nbsp;Hours before the new pope was elected, I spoke with Molly Kinder, a fellow at the Brookings institution who’s an expert in AI and labor policy. Her research on the Vatican, labour, and AI was <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-unexpected-visionary-pope-francis-on-ai-humanity-and-the-future-of-work/">published</a> with Brookings following Pope Francis’s death.</p>



<p>She described how the Catholic Church has a deep-held belief in the dignity of work — and how AI evangelists’ promise to create a post-work society with artificial intelligence is at odds with that.</p>



<p>“Pope John Paul II wrote something that I found really fascinating. He said, ‘work makes us more human.’ And Silicon Valley is basically racing to create a technology that will replace humans at work,” Kinder, who was raised Catholic, told me. “What they're endeavoring to do is disrupt some of the very core tenets of how we've interpreted God's mission for what makes us human.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>“Russia rejoices,” <a href="https://x.com/donaldtusk/status/1922344013832626355">wrote</a> the pro-European Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk on X this week. He was referring to a joint <a href="https://www.barrons.com/news/polish-president-meets-romania-s-far-right-simion-aa99f4a4">appearance</a> onstage in Warsaw of George Simion, the far right presidential candidate in Romania, and his Polish equivalent Karol Nawrocki just days before elections in both countries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On May 18, Romanians will vote in the second and final round of elections to pick their president, with Simion, a decisive first round winner, the favourite, albeit current polling shows he is <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/poll-shows-romanian-hard-right-centrist-candidates-tied-ahead-run-off-2025-05-13/">running</a> neck-and-neck with his opponent Nicusor Dan, the relatively liberal current mayor of Bucharest. Also on that day, the first round of Poland’s presidential elections will take place. Nawrocki, analysts <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/poland-choose-between-pro-eu-maga-paths-presidential-vote-2025-05-14/">suggest</a>, is likely to lose to the more liberal Warsaw mayor Rafał Trzaskowski.&nbsp;</p>





<p>But Simion’s appearance in Warsaw did cause anger, with one Polish member of the European parliament <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/news/warsaw-bucharest-axis-sparks-backlash-days-before-vote/">describing</a> both candidates as representatives of “Putin’s international”. Simion denies being pro-Kremlin, but wants to stop military aid to Ukraine. An ultranationalist, he promotes the rebuilding of a greater Romania, raising the prospect of potential territorial <a href="https://codastory.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=2917466ad5ae7d0be32196119&amp;id=eba06bf13d&amp;e=8bcc9c409b">disputes</a> with Ukraine, Moldova, and Bulgaria. Indeed, he is already banned from entering both Moldova and Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rather than Russia, the association Simion prefers to acknowledge is with Donald Trump and MAGA. As he said of his visit to Poland and support for Nawrocki, “Together, we could become two pro-MAGA presidents committed to reviving our partnership with the United States and strengthening stability along NATO’s eastern flank.”</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">Certainly, Simion’s MAGA love was on show during the first round of Romania’s election on May 4, and MAGA reciprocated that love.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the party’s Bucharest headquarters, on a warm, triumphant election night, with Simion having won over 40% of the votes, a MAGA hat-wearing American took to the podium. He asked the cheering crowd if they wanted their own "Trump hat", and threw one (and only one) towards a section chanting "MAGA, MAGA, MAGA." Brian Brown, a prominent conservative activist, was in his element, expressing solidarity with jubilant Simion supporters.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"You, my friends," he said, "are in the eye of the storm. What happens in this country will define what happens all over Europe. And Americans know it and more and more are waking up to the truth that we must stand together. We must never be silenced." Meanwhile, a protester screaming “fascists” was quickly removed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Brown, who leads the anti-LGBTQ group International Organization for the Family and has been described by human rights organizations as an "infamous exporter of hate and vocal Putin supporter," was celebrating a seismic political shift. In response to Simion’s large first round victory, Romania's prime minister resigned. His own party's establishment candidate didn’t even make it to the May 18 second round.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Simion, a 38-year-old Eurosceptic and self-described "Trumpist," had founded his far-right nationalist party, Alliance for the Union of Romanians (AUR) just over a decade ago. At the AUR offices on election night – with Simion himself only appearing by video – Brown drew explicit parallels between Romania's situation and that of America, extolling the "friendship of true Romanians and true Americans, people that stand together against a lie." Right wing leaders in other countries echoed the sentiment. Italy's deputy prime minister Matteo Salvini, for instance, declared on social media that Romanians had "finally voted, freely, with their heads and hearts."&nbsp;</p>



<p>Romania's election became a right wing cause célèbre after the Constitutional Court annulled the presidential polls in December last year, ruling that it had been vitiated by a Russian influence operation. U.S. vice president JD Vance accused Romania of canceling the election based on “flimsy suspicions” and Elon Musk <a href="https://codastory.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=2917466ad5ae7d0be32196119&amp;id=0c18f3f75d&amp;e=8bcc9c409b">described</a> the head of the Constitutional Court as a “tyrant”. This is why MAGA supporters took a keen interest in the May 4 do-over. It was, according to&nbsp; Brown, a litmus test for freedom, for the voters’ right to choose their president, no matter how unpalatable he might be to the establishment.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>In November, 2024, far-right candidate Călin Georgescu won the first round of Romania’s presidential elections. The polls were scuppered though after intelligence revealed <a href="https://codastory.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=2917466ad5ae7d0be32196119&amp;id=6366bb6630&amp;e=8bcc9c409b">irregularities</a> in campaign funding and that Russia had been involved in the <a href="https://codastory.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=2917466ad5ae7d0be32196119&amp;id=c68a6e0ed3&amp;e=8bcc9c409b">setting up</a> of almost 800 TikTok accounts backing Georgescu’s candidacy. He was also barred from participating in the rerun.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls src="https://www.codastory.com/brian-brown-mp4/"></video><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Brian Brown, prominent Trump supporter and MAGA activist, takes to the podium at the AUR headquarters in Bucharest to celebrate the "friendship of true Romanians and true Americans."

<p class="has-drop-cap">Distrust and disapproval of Romania’s political system have been growing ever since. When I got to Bucharest, my taxi driver, the first person I met, told me he wouldn’t even bother voting in the rerun. The ban on Georgescu was portrayed in right wing circles as anti-democratic. And the support he received from leading Trump administration figures such as Vance was in keeping with their support for far-right parties across Europe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before Friedrich Merz won a contentious parliamentary vote to become German Chancellor, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Germany was a “tyranny in disguise” because its intelligence services classified the anti-immigration AfD, now Germany’s main opposition party, as “confirmed right wing extremist[s].” Vance <a href="https://codastory.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=2917466ad5ae7d0be32196119&amp;id=b166db43ad&amp;e=8bcc9c409b">said</a> the “bureaucrats” were trying to destroy “the most popular party in Germany.” It proved, he added, that decades after the West brought down the Berlin Wall, the German establishment had “rebuilt” it. The outspoken nature of this intervention in the internal politics of an ally shows that the Trump administration would rather maintain ideological ties with far-right parties in Europe than follow traditional diplomatic protocols.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Simion, for his part, has <a href="https://codastory.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=2917466ad5ae7d0be32196119&amp;id=e27d3d78fc&amp;e=8bcc9c409b">said</a> that he’s a natural ally of the U.S. Republican Party, and that AUR is “almost perfectly aligned ideologically with the MAGA movement.” Just two weeks before the Romanian elections, Brian Brown met with Simion and his wife in Washington, D.C., with both men <a href="https://codastory.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=2917466ad5ae7d0be32196119&amp;id=d20d34e4c3&amp;e=8bcc9c409b">propagating</a> their affinity to “the free world” and “Judeo-Christian legacy” in an Instagram video. Simion is also currently being <a href="https://codastory.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=2917466ad5ae7d0be32196119&amp;id=e411fc0359&amp;e=8bcc9c409b">scrutinized</a> over attempts to <a href="https://codastory.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=2917466ad5ae7d0be32196119&amp;id=d2815b628f&amp;e=8bcc9c409b">hire</a> a lobbying firm in the U.S. for $1.5 million to secure meetings with key American political figures and media appearances with U.S. journalists.&nbsp;</p>





<p>In Romania, the president has a semi-executive role that comes with considerable powers over foreign policy, national security, defence spending and judicial appointments. The Romanian president also represents the country on the international stage and can veto important EU votes – a level of influence that might be considered handy on the other side of the Atlantic too.</p>



<p>The fact that both U.S. and other European far-right leaders came in person to offer their support to Simion after the first round of the election, or paid obeisance online, shows how it’s becoming increasingly important for the far-right to to be seen as a coherent, global force. As Brown put it in Bucharest: “We need MAGA and MEGA. Make America great again. Make Europe great again.”&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>With Canada and Australia swinging to the center-left in their recent elections – in what many have called “the Trump slump” – the Romanian election offers Trump and MAGA hope that it can continue to remake the world in its own image. The irony is that MAGA, with its global offshoots, is arguably the most effective contemporary international solidarity movement, despite railing against globalism and being so apparently parochial in its outlook.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Apparently, the word <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/wordplay/your-deadline-wont-kill-you">“deadline”</a> was first coined in a notoriously brutal Confederacy-run prison during the American Civil War: any prisoners that crossed the line got killed. The point of a deadline is that, if you don’t stick to it, there are severe consequences. So what do you call a line that, should you cross it, brings zero consequences? A shrug-line? A meh-line? A British-Overseas-Territories-line?</p>



<p>“Anguilla, Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands (BVI), the Cayman Islands and the Turks and Caicos Islands will have legislation on registers of beneficial ownership approved through their respective legislatures by April 2025, with implementation by June 2025 or earlier,” was the unequivocal deadline in a joint communiqué <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-and-overseas-territories-joint-ministerial-council-2024-communique">agreed</a> by the British government and the leaders of these five of its Overseas Territories (OTs) in November last year.</p>





<p>It's now May and, well, that has not <a href="https://www.transparency.org.uk/news/overseas-territories-miss-another-critical-deadline-enhanced-corporate-transparency">come to pass</a>. The deadline has been crossed. So what will happen now that all of them (except the Cayman Islands) have failed to approve laws to open up their corporate registries? Will someone get shot? Or will everyone just shuffle about a bit and hope no one’s noticed?</p>



<p>These five jurisdictions are leftover bits of the British Empire which, for various reasons, never became independent. London wasn’t particularly keen on keeping them, mainly because doing so was expensive, so back in the 1960s, ‘70s and ‘80s, they were encouraged to find ways to fund themselves, with no one particularly caring how they went about it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Each of these territories, to varying extents, discovered that there was profit to be made from helping foreigners to move money, and not asking too many questions about where the money came from. As a result, these places are often referred to as tax havens, but that’s misleading since they offer far more than just tax advantages to their clients.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Shell companies, particularly those of the BVI, became <a href="https://www.transparency.org.uk/news/smokescreen-secrecy#:~:text=BVI%2Dregistered%20companies%20have%20long,obscure%20the%20identity%20of%20owners.">notorious</a> for hiding money for gangsters, tax dodgers, cartels, kleptocrats and other crooks, and the British government struggled to do anything about it. Then, in 2018, <a href="https://www.andrew-mitchell-mp.co.uk/parliament/andrew-mitchell-urges-immediate-action-overseas-territories-transparency-tackle-dirty">a group of backbench MPs</a> seized on the post-Brexit collapse in political coherence and passed a law forcing the OTs to open up their corporate registries so everyone could see who actually owned their companies.</p>



<p>The law came with a deadline: the end of 2020. But no one obeyed it, so it was extended by the British government to 2023. No one obeyed that deadline either, so it was extended again to April 2025. And now? It’s all just a bit embarrassing.</p>



<p>“We must stop the dither and delay of recent years and pierce the veil of anonymity that protects criminals and kleptocrats,” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/17/uk-territories-laundering-money-crime-margaret-hodge-andrew-mitchell">said</a> Margaret Hodge and Andrew Mitchell, architects of the 2018 legislation, back in November last year. But dither and delay persist.</p>



<p>The debate gets caught up in allegations of ignorance, colonialism, arrogance and so on, but it really comes down to one important point: no one in power in Britain cares enough about stopping corruption to take the political and financial hit of overruling the OTs’ own politicians and paying their bills. More than half of the BVI’s <a href="https://bvi.gov.vg/sites/default/files/2025_Budget_Estimates_-_Final_V4.pdf">budget</a> comes directly from company incorporation fees. What money do you replace that with, if you change the rules so that no one wants to set up shell companies there anymore?</p>



<p>In the case of Anguilla, a surprising amount of money – around <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZsHbQYomj0lilcoolmcfW_Bbg0v6piLq/view?fbclid=IwY2xjawHENl1leHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHdUr8bKrjEyfX0NvcMC70lOY6LkwJamE_DMzadqJ2P14u03SdtG7TrW04Q_aem_RV-Mr24L8w0omNSdvExffw">$50 million</a> this year, apparently, which is about a third of all its revenues – comes from its domain name, which is the fortuitous .ai. But that’s not an option open to the other OTs, and if they ask too many questions about who’s doing business with them, that business will go elsewhere.</p>



<p><strong>TETHERED TO EL SALVADOR</strong></p>



<p>One business that already has gone elsewhere is <a href="https://tether.io/">Tether</a>, the crypto company that runs the world’s most popular stablecoin USDT, which has almost <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/USDT/">$150 billion</a> worth in circulation, and incidentally has a domain name -- .io – derived from yet another random imperial <a href="https://www.biot.gov.io/">fragment</a>, the British Indian Ocean Territory. Previously <a href="https://www.voanews.com/a/crypto-firm-tether-and-its-founders-finalizing-move-to-el-salvador-/7935830.html">registered</a> in the BVI, Tether relocated to El Salvador earlier this year after it obtained a license from President Nayib Bukele’s government.</p>



<p>Bukele, whose in his X bio currently describes himself as a “philosopher king”, is much <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/04/16/nx-s1-5366178/trump-deport-jail-u-s-citizens-homegrowns-el-salvador">caressed </a>by the American right, who love him for his willingness to indefinitely lock up not just Salvadorans but anyone the U.S. wants to imprison without bothering first to check if they’re guilty or not. Bukele’s methods, the American right says, has made El Salvador safer. But, thanks to journalists from <a href="https://beta.elfaro.net/en?ref=elfaronet">El Faro</a>, we have yet more evidence that the decline in crime that he boasts of may be at least as much to do with secret <a href="https://english.elpais.com/international/2025-05-02/a-gang-leader-released-by-bukele-reveals-his-pacts-with-the-government-of-el-salvador.html">negotiations</a> with gangsters as it is to do with arresting them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Gangs turned Bukele into a relevant politician,” said El Faro’s editor-in-chief Óscar Martínez. “It is impossible to understand Bukele’s rise to total power without his association with gangs.”</p>



<p>So how does a man who’s previously <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/sep/26/naybib-bukele-el-salvador-president-coolest-dictator">called</a> himself the “world’s coolest dictator” respond to press reports like these? By threatening to <a href="https://elfaro.net/en/202515/el_salvador/27826/el-faro-denounces-possible-arrest-warrants-for-at-least-seven-staff-members-in-el-salvador">lock up</a> the journalists involved of course, allegedly with investigations under criminal statutes often used against gangsters.</p>



<p>“Treating journalism as a criminal act deprives Salvadorans of essential information,” <a href="https://cpj.org/2025/05/7-salvadorian-journalists-face-charges-after-report-on-presidents-alleged-gang-ties/">said</a> Cristina Zahar, Latin America programme coordinator at the Committee to Protect Journalists. “Prosecutors should abandon these cases now and ensure ‘El Faro’ journalists can safely report on matters of public interest.”</p>





<p>Tether has no problems with El Salvador’s political atmosphere and complexities. It plans to build a 70-storey tower in the capital, San Salvador, which will serve both as its headquarters and as a location for other finance companies. “It is the country of the future,” <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/tether-discusses-70-story-skyscraper-construction-in-el-salvador-it-is-the-country-of-the-future/">says</a> Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The fact that the stablecoin issuer is bedding so comfortably into a place like El Salvador is bad news for people who <a href="https://www.int-comp.org/insight/stablecoins-the-new-epicentre-of-crypto-fraud/">worry</a> about Tether’s outsized role in enabling global money laundering, but potentially good news for Bukele, who has made crypto a key part of his <a href="https://elsalvadorinenglish.com/2025/01/15/president-bukele-this-year-will-be-exponential-for-bitcoin-and-its-global-ecosystem/">development plan</a> for his chronically-indebted nation. It’s too early to say whether this has worked – although it’s also too early, no matter what “The Economist”<a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2025/03/02/el-salvadors-wild-crypto-experiment-ends-in-failure"> might think</a>, to say that it hasn’t --&nbsp; but it’s an interesting echo of the British OTs’ twentieth-century model: undercut everyone else’s regulations, enable crime overseas, and make a good living out of it.</p>



<p>It's too much to hope that, as a civilisation, we’d have learned from our mistake sufficiently not to repeat it, but I do hope we’re not still going to be arguing about how to solve the resulting problems in 50 years time.<br></p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Donald Trump is taking credit for preventing a catastrophic war between nuclear powers India and Pakistan. Delhi is not amused</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>It happened so quickly.</p>



<p>On Friday afternoon in Delhi, I was at my daughter's school, waiting to pick her up and straining to eavesdrop on knots of parents and -- this being Delhi -- separate knots of household staff. Every tightly bunched group was absorbed by conversation on the only subject anyone in Delhi, and no doubt the rest of India, was talking about: are we going to war with Pakistan?</p>



<p>By Saturday afternoon, my assumption that India and Pakistan would find a way to step back from the brink because they had no other serious choice, seemed wildly optimistic. On the jingoistic, cacophonous, largely unwatchable Indian news channels, there were still reports of drones being shot down and air bases and military infrastructure being attacked. War seemed imminent. So imminent that India’s largest-selling weekly newsmagazine went with “War!” and a battalion of fighter jets on its cover.&nbsp;</p>





<p>But by five pm on Saturday, Donald Trump announced a complete ceasefire. Before anyone from the Indian or Pakistani government had said anything. Entire nations were caught off guard. The screeching newsreaders, still foaming at the mouth, were outraged – “who moved my war?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>And then the media swiveled on a dime (rather, a one-rupee coin). Spinning furiously, crazed hamsters on their wheels, the analysts and anchors insisted India had won. In Pakistan, their counterparts were doing much the same. The truth is, both countries had lost&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">India and Pakistan had been locked in a clumsy, deadly two-step while the rest of the world looked away. It began on April 22, with a terrorist attack in Pahalgam, Kashmir, in which 26 men, almost all of them Hindu, and singled out for their religious affiliation, were killed. United States Vice President JD Vance, was in India on a “private trip” at the time, with his Indian-American wife and children.</p>



<p>The attack was a provocation that the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist government could not tolerate. Their supporters bayed for vengeance. And Modi, whose personal brand as the protector of the Hindu nation – boasting in campaign speeches about his 56-inch chest – is predicated on him being the leader of a newly vigorous, aggressive India, an emerging superpower, had to respond with overwhelming force.</p>



<p>It took two weeks -- during which India did not provide proof of the Pakistani state's involvement in the April 22 attack beyond an established history of Pakistan’s financing of terror. The country featured on the Financial Action Task Force's grey list between 2018 and 2022, though it insists it has since largely cleaned up its act. Indian retribution came in the form of the bombing of what India described as terrorist camps. This was, Indian officials said, a restrained, responsible response to Pakistan-sponsored terrorism. No military sites, for example, were hit.</p>



<p>Pakistan said civilians were killed and that mosques were bombed. They then retaliated to India's retaliation. And India retaliated to Pakistan’s retaliation against India’s retaliation. Inevitably, there was a retaliation to the retaliation to the retaliation against the retaliation. And so on, until Trump announced the ceasefire. As the bombings intensified, both India and Pakistan insisted they didn't want war and were taking responsible actions to de-escalate. In the warped logic of this fighting, the bombs being dropped actually signaled both countries' understanding that they could go so far and no further.</p>



<p>Initially, the United States, which has played a part in brokering peace in previous clashes between India and Pakistan, seemed content to let both countries duke it out. It’s “none of our business,” said Vance. While Donald Trump seemed to<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCZ0xnZslmA"> think</a> the dispute over Kashmir was the latest episode of a show that dated back "1,000 years, probably longer." Later, he modified this assessment to mere centuries.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">The truth is, this conflict is a product of British colonial rule, of the hastily conceived and disastrously executed partition of India in 1947. The Cliffs notes, with considerable nuance lost through inadequate summary, are as follows: Kashmir, a Muslim-majority state with a Hindu king, wanted to be independent of both India and Pakistan. But when Pakistani forces invaded Kashmir in October, 1947, the king asked India for help and signed an agreement binding Kashmir to the Indian union.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It led to the first war between Pakistan and India, nations that were born just weeks earlier as the British departed. Under the terms of a United Nations-negotiated ceasefire, India gained control of about two-thirds of Kashmir. But this was temporary until a plebiscite to determine the future of Kashmir was held. This plebiscite never happened. As a result, both countries believe they have an inalienable right to the entirety of Kashmir: India because of the king's decision to sign the instrument of accession; Pakistan because Kashmir is a Muslim-majority state and Pakistan was created as a homeland for the subcontinent's Muslims. In 1965, both countries fought another inconclusive war.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>But as long as India continues to pretend there is a viable military solution to its disputes with Pakistan, the prospect of conflict, if not outright war, remains an ever-present Damoclean threat.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>But since 1989, as the Soviet Union collapsed and there was a proliferation of US-funded mujahideen in the region, separatist sentiments in Kashmir spiraled into violent insurgency. India says these militants are a proxy, a tool of the Pakistani deep state. So Kashmir became a theater of both postcolonial and post-Cold War conflict.</p>



<p>Between 1999 and 2019, the U.S. reliably <a href="https://www.belfercenter.org/research-analysis/has-us-prevented-another-india-pakistan-war">talked</a> both countries off the ledge and leading international diplomatic efforts to get India and Pakistan to back off when overly aggressive gestures and posturing threatened to become kinetic. The U.S. has Cold War-era strategic and security ties with Pakistan but only recently has India become a close partner with an active role to play in containing China’s emerging dominance. India, Australia, Japan and the U.S. are part of the Quad, a loose grouping intended to counter China’s designs on the Indo-Pacific.</p>



<p>Modi and Trump have made several displays of personal friendship, each supporting the other’s election campaigns. But the Trump administration had declined to intervene in current tensions. It was a position of apathy, as if it had no stake in preventing war. For Modi, it must sting that carefully choreographed hugs with Western leaders had not resulted in more diplomatic support for his military action against Pakistan.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Modi also received little support from institutions. For instance,&nbsp; India had lobbied for the IMF to withhold funds from Pakistan. But the IMF chose to release $1 billion in loans to Islamabad, even as Pakistan was engaged in artillery exchanges with India. With the U.S. seemingly taking a back seat, Saudi Arabia and Iran had offered to mediate, as had Russia. Even China, which provides over 80% of the Pakistani army's weaponry and also administers part of Kashmir, said it would help broker peace.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But it was the U.S. that swooped in over the weekend. Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio both posted about the negotiations, with Trump even saying he had used trade as leverage to prevent a nuclear war. “Millions of people,” he&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/A90ePbj6BBE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>, “could have been killed.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.codastory.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Press-Information-Bureau-PIB-Anadolu-via-Getty-Images-1800x1161.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-56452"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi greeting "our brave air warriors and soldiers" on May 13 at an air force base in Adampur, Punjab. Press Information Bureau (PIB)/Anadolu via Getty Images.</figcaption></figure>



<p class="has-drop-cap">While Pakistan were happy to acknowledge the U.S. role in forcing a truce, Indian diplomats and politicians were either tight-lipped or disapproving. India has long resisted external interference in the Kashmir dispute, insisting that negotiations have to be strictly bilateral. Ultimately, neither India nor Pakistan can afford full-scale war. This is not asymmetrical combat. India may be much larger than Pakistan and conventionally more powerful. It may have a growing economy, while Pakistan is struggling to finance its debts. But, as one British analyst<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBUf7N_0j04"> said</a>, if this is a Goliath-David struggle, David has a nuclear weapon in his sling.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Trump-brokered ceasefire may only be temporary respite – so temporary, indeed, that barely hours after the agreement was announced, the chief minister of Indian-administered Kashmir posted on X that he had heard explosions in the state capital Srinagar. “What the hell,” he <a href="https://x.com/OmarAbdullah?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">wrote</a>, “just happened to the ceasefire?” But as long as India continues to pretend there is a viable military solution to its disputes with Pakistan, the prospect of conflict, if not outright war, remains an ever-present Damoclean threat.</p>



<p>As an Indian citizen and a parent, I find both governments' confidence that they can toe an invisible line more than a little disconcerting. But, judging by the political and media response to the prospect of war, only a few shared my scepticism. In India, since April 22, there have been very few calls for peace, very few questions about the need for a military response to a terrorist attack, even though bombing Pakistan has not deterred subsequent terrorism.</p>



<p class="has-drop-cap">One of those calls for peace, though, came from Himanshi Narwal, whose husband of six days, an Indian navy officer, was shot in front of her. Narwal, who was photographed kneeling beside her husband's prone body, became a symbol of India's grief and outrage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That was before she spoke. Narwal told reporters that she only held the men who had murdered her husband responsible and not all Muslims or all Kashmiris. "We want peace," she<a href="https://x.com/ANI/status/1917869081773904195"> said</a>, "and only peace."</p>



<p>This sentiment made her a target of Hindu nationalist scorn on social media. Narwal was excoriated as a "woke secular" – a particularly Indian insult, mixing American right wing culture war tropes with the Indian use of the word "secular" to mock Indian liberals who supposedly kowtow to minorities, particularly Muslims.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>India's initial retaliation was given the code name "Operation Sindoor", a reference to the deep red powder some married Hindu women dab on the parting of their hair or on their foreheads. India's military action, in other words, was being taken on behalf of the women who had lost their husbands on April 22. Women like Himanshi Narwal. Though what she, and others like her, might think is apparently besides the point or even worthy of contempt.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The contrast between Narwal's dignity and the absurd propaganda peddled by the mainstream Indian media would have been comical if it were not simultaneously so depressing. On Friday evening, a friend, an editor at a national magazine, sent me a collection of screen grabs of headlines in India, mostly from television news. Each claim was remarkable -- Pakistani planes being shot out of the sky, rebels from Balochistan capturing the city of Quetta, the Indian navy bombing Karachi, even reports of a coup -- and each claim was either knowingly false or entirely unverified. On Indian TV screens every night, since Wednesday night when India first bombed its targets in Pakistan, we've been exposed to a tale told by idiots.</p>



<p>&nbsp;Was it too much to hope for some restraint? But the tone taken by the mainstream media, a mimicking of the abrasive arrogance of Hindu nationalist trolls on social media, was matched by the Indian government. I watched a spokesperson from the BJP, India's governing party, <a href="https://x.com/JaiveerShergill/status/1920546224572080243">tell</a> a British news channel about Modi's "3E policy -- evaporate, eradicate, eliminate... shameless Pakistan needs to be taught a lesson." Oy vey!&nbsp;</p>





<p>And now, does the ceasefire mean that the so-called 3E policy has been abandoned? Would the Modi government – which had <a href="https://frontline.thehindu.com/news/india-pakistan-tensions-censorship-press-freedom-social-media-ban/article69560634.ece">blocked</a> the few critical, independent voices – have the courage to reimagine its response to Pakistan, to reevaluate the belligerence of its rhetoric, and to instead embrace the inherent strength in India’s secular, constitutional values and enter into constructive dialogue?</p>



<p>The signs are not encouraging. In a late bid to wrest the narrative momentum from Donald Trump, Indian politicians, journalists and commentators spread word of the country’s new approach to terrorism. Modi, having been silent through much of the fighting, elaborated on the “new normal,” in an <a href="https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2128268">address</a> to the nation on Monday night. India, he said, would no longer distinguish “between the government sponsoring terrorism and the masterminds of terrorism.” The words were belligerent, the policies no kind of solution.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Perhaps, India’s wounds are still too raw for self-reflection. But the question remains: Is India going to be held hostage to its own anger? Or will it acknowledge that talks, and people to people contact, must resume.</p>
