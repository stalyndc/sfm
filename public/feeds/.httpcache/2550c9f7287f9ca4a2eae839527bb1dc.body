    <p> </p><p>The path that leads him into the woods is paved in smooth stone, dark like the earth after rain. Link walks with the clink of golden armour and there is nobody around to hear it. Folk in these parts know better than to follow roads that stay pretty without being tended. Bandits swarm in the dusty by-lanes, but better to have coin stolen and barns raided than to chance the gaping maw of the trees.</p><p> </p><p>People have mercy. Forests don’t.</p><p> </p><p>He walks into the mist. The road winds around in circles, then peters out, slowly, like a river reaching the sea. His boots sink into grass that brushes his knees. He can feel eyes on his spine.</p><p> </p><p>He takes a deep breath and releases it.</p><p> </p><p>He was born here. But he does not belong here. He knows the feeling of the sun through the trees better than he knows his name, or his face, or the sword calluses on his palm, but the wood is perilous to him still.</p><p> </p><p>The easy way leads deeper, to the heart, the places he cannot find again and will lose himself trying. And he is here only for a shortcut. Time is different in the woods. Slower. Thicker. So he must take the harder way, through the nettles and the thorns. </p><p> </p><p>If all goes well, he will pass without disturbing anything that sleeps here, and will emerge from the thickets behind Castle Town at the other end of the country—how soon, he can’t tell. No more than a kokiri hour, as the children used to say, even though he can’t remember how long the kokiri hour was.</p><p> </p><p>“Boything,” something whispers to him. He sighs.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, kid?”</p><p> </p><p>The puppet looks at him, wide-eyed. “Boything,” it says again, like it’s testing the word out. It doesn’t know his name. He’s not young and innocent enough to give it. Better to be nameless.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes?” he answers, though it’s been decades since anybody called him a boy. He used to be one, he thinks. Briefly. In between being a child and a monster.</p><p> </p><p>The puppet’s finger twitches as he sets down the pack full of masks and lets his sword fall to rest beneath a tree. A dedicated finger of wind is winding carefully through the trees. He tips his head and lets it cool his skin.</p><p> </p><p>“There’s people in the woods,” the puppet tells him, with insects instead of pupils caught in the amber eyes of its wooden face. The one in the left eye looks like some sort of wasp, angry and black and long extinct. All the kids are older than ancient. Time moves differently in the woods.</p><p> </p><p>“People?” he repeats. Another puppet crawls out of the shrubbery, joints sliding in opposition to his own. “Can’t you chase them out of the woods?”</p><p> </p><p>“We think you should do it,” the second kid confides. “These ones are different.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re being interrupted at a game,” he translates.</p><p> </p><p>Neither kid will meet his eyes, which all but confirms it. A third puppet suddenly touches the small of his back and he catches himself from leaping a foot into the air. “Boything, you’re gold,” it says wonderingly.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s armour,” he replies patiently, and brushes the thing’s wooden hands off his belt, retrieving the tiny hunting knife that has been quietly taken from him. The puppet lets him take it, hands placid and easy to manoeuvre, like a child’s. “For protection.”</p><p> </p><p>“We can do protection,” the kids offer. “Without gold, even.”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s kind,” he tells them, politely, “but I like my armour.”</p><p> </p><p>Protection to a skull kid is wood and mist and eternity. He cannot lose himself now. She’s waiting for him at home, a lanturn burning in the window.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay,” he says. “I’ll lead them out.”</p><p> </p><p>“Out, in,” the first kid says idly. “Doesn’t matter. Make them go.”</p><p> </p><p>“Okay,” he says again. There’s nothing else he can say.</p><p> </p><p>If the kids could move their faces, he thinks they would smile. As it is, laughter bubbles from their wooden throats. The grins carved into their faces seem a little more sincere. “You’re welcome to join the game,” one of them burbles instead of thanks. The forest does not say thanks.</p><p> </p><p>“Once they’re gone?”</p><p> </p><p>“Once they’re gone!” the kids agree, and run in their jerky, shuddering way under the low-hanging branch of a shadowy tree, into fog so white he cannot see them go. He buckles his pack and picks up his sword. The forest must not be allowed to steal them.</p><p> </p><p>He will have to make a detour on his shortcut. No matter. Time moves differently in the woods. It slips and slides around—changes faces in the unblinking stare of an amber eye, in the wind that can’t decide which direction to blow from, the compass that spins never ending. He’ll still be early if he needs to.</p><p><br />
<br />
</p><p> </p><hr /><p> </p><p><br />
<br />
</p><p>The campsite is damp and shrouded in tricky tendrils of mist, but it’s the best one they’ve found for weeks. Wild sits on the ground with his knees tucked into his chest and turns the slate on and off again obsessively.</p><p> </p><p>“Still fried?” Legend asks. </p><p> </p><p>Wild hums. He bashes the screen with the flat of his palm. <em> Error, </em> the map tells him. <em> Signal not found </em>.</p><p> </p><p>“The portal killed it,” he says mournfully. He shakes it. Is that rattling? Is something loose? “The portal killed it stone dead.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’ve still got half your inventory,” Legend offers. “Even if it glitches every time you try to take something out.”</p><p> </p><p>“Stone dead,” Wild repeats. “Might as well <em> be </em> a stone.” He swivels suddenly. “How’d you know about my inventory?”</p><p> </p><p>Legend smirks. Wild throws a twig at him and retreats up a tree to sulk. He settles in a thick, broad fork. Leaves cradle him. He squirms onto his stomach until he can see through a gap in the canopy. Warriors is arguing with Four about the correct way to set up bedrolls.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, where’d Wild go?” Sky asks suddenly.</p><p> </p><p>“He died with the slate,” Legend responds. He tucks himself into Sky’s side like always—closer than any of the rest of them are allowed. Legend has a very distinct sense of personal space, but for some reason he’s never bothered to tell Sky about it. And Sky gives out hugs like clouds give rain and plants give flowers. “Turns out it was life support. I buried him over behind that gloomy-looking tree.”</p><p> </p><p>“They’re all gloomy-looking,” Sky responds, instead of questioning Wild’s death appropriately. Wild feels a little offended.</p><p> </p><p>“That one’s gloomier than most,” Legend says.</p><p> </p><p>Sky squints thoughtfully. “Can’t see it,” he decides. It’s outrageous. Does he not care that one of his reincarnations has reportedly kicked the bucket right there in the woods?</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not dead,” Wild says from the tree. He watches Sky hide a smile and pouts. So he was just pretending.</p><p> </p><p>“Sometimes I can still hear his voice,” Legend says airily. Sky hums.</p><p> </p><p>Wild growls and drops out of the tree onto his head. His pride has been bruised. He puts a knee in Legend’s stomach.</p><p> </p><p>Legend elbows him in the head and sweeps his ankles out from under him. Wild makes a furious, intelligible sound, and launches himself forward from his hands and knees. Like the bears in Tabantha when they get spooked. Like the foxes that flee from the undergrowth. He ducks under Legend’s fist and digs his fingernails into Legend’s arm—shouts at the pained grunt Legend gives him—rolls under a vicious kick that was heading straight for his shins and opens his mouth and pushes his face towards Legend’s other arm and—</p><p> </p><p>A hand hooks itself in the collar of his tunic and yanks him back. A whine slips out of him. He shakes it off with a full-body shudder. Sometimes he thinks he spent too long with the beasts after he woke. When he’s startled their languages fall out of him more easily than recalcitrant, relearnt hylian words. </p><p> </p><p>Legend’s panting, just an arms-length away, red-faced and defiant. Blood is dripping down his forearm from the scratches. The hand on the back of Wild’s shirt shakes him lightly, once, and lets him drop. Wild lets himself fall. He lands catlike on his feet, back slumped.</p><p> </p><p>“That’s enough fighting,” Sky says quietly.</p><p> </p><p>Wild looks away, ashamed. </p><p> </p><p>“Whatever,” Legend sneers. There’s a familiar spark of adrenaline leaping in his eye. Wild isn’t very good at reading faces—he can’t tell if Legend is angry, or just proud, or in denial that he was losing. It would be easier if he was a beast. If he used his body to talk instead of his duplicitous mouth. “It wasn’t me who started it.”</p><p> </p><p>“Sorry, did I ask?” Sky says.</p><p> </p><p>“Didn’t mean it,” Wild sulks. “Just a fight.” </p><p> </p><p>He never used to have this problem before he found out there were still people alive in the world who weren’t either a ghost king or a half-dead princess waiting for him in a castle. Before he realised that to talk to people in Kakariko and Hateno and Tarry Town he had to use <em> words </em>and not just teeth. </p><p> </p><p>Beasts understand teeth very well. It turned out that people do not.</p><p> </p><p>Sky levels him with a carefully polite expression that wouldn’t look out of place on Impa. “You can’t attack your allies whenever you feel like it,” he says patiently.</p><p> </p><p>Legend bares his teeth at Wild. Wild snarls back. He shifts his weight forward into the balls of his feet, ready to pounce. Then he remembers Sky.</p><p> </p><p>“No,” Sky tells them both. “No,” and that’s the end of it. He hustles Wild off to the other end of the clearing and sets him down in front of the pot. Then he takes Legend over to Warriors, who carries bandages in his belt pouch for this sort of thing.</p><p> </p><p>“Stop fussing,” Legend grunts.</p><p> </p><p>“He tried to <em> bite </em>you,” Sky says in a murmur that wasn’t as low as it was likely supposed to be.</p><p> </p><p>“I think he was just playing. Probably.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m sorry,” says Warriors, “he <em> what?” </em></p><p> </p><p>“More beast than man, that one,” Sky says wisely. “Goddess love him, but he doesn’t take teasing very well at all.”</p><p> </p><p>“Maybe you should stop teasing him, then,” Four says.</p><p> </p><p>“I think he can handle it,” Legend disagrees, “it’s just that nobody’s taught him how to tease back.”</p><p> </p><p>Twilight appears from behind Wild’s shoulder and sticks his head in the empty pot curiously. “What’s up, cub?” </p><p> </p><p>“Nothing,” Wild grumbles. He presses the button on his slate to take out a carrot. It beeps aggressively at him. The screen freezes. He whacks it on the edge of the pot.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey—hey,” Twilight says, catching his hand and giving his fingers a light squeeze. “Don’t do that. It’ll break.”</p><p> </p><p>“Already broken.”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s no reason to break it more,” he suggests logically.</p><p> </p><p>“I hate you,” Wild says.</p><p> </p><p>Twilight laughs at him. “No, you don’t. You’re just frustrated. What’s up?”</p><p> </p><p>Wild makes a vague sound of discontent. “Dunno,” he says, and shivers. He tries the button again. A wrinkled, wormy carrot drops into his palm.</p><p> </p><p>Twilight waits.</p><p> </p><p>“Tried to bite Legend,” Wild says eventually. </p><p> </p><p>“Oh, cub,” Twilight snorts. He looks almost amused. “That’s the fifth time this week.”</p><p> </p><p>“He’s biteable,” Wild agrees. He shrugs. “I don’t know. I just keep—and they don’t get it. I’m not trying to be mean.”</p><p> </p><p>Twilight hums. He looks thoughtful. “You know what I think? I think it’s the woods.”</p><p> </p><p>“What?”</p><p> </p><p>“These woods are getting everyone on edge.”</p><p> </p><p>Wild scoffs. He coaxes another carrot from the slate.</p><p> </p><p>“We can’t find an end to them,” Twilight outlines, “we’ve been walking for—what, twenty-three days now? With no change in scenery? We move slower as a group than any of us do individually. I know you’re used to running, cub. It must be driving you crazy.”</p><p> </p><p>Wild dumps the carrots back in the slate. Useless. “Did you find any meat?” he says flatly.</p><p> </p><p>“Listen,” Twilight says. “You’ve heard it.”</p><p> </p><p>“The silence,” he acknowledges, grudging.</p><p> </p><p>“No birds,” Twilight says, “no insects, no game. Nothing to hunt.”</p><p> </p><p>“No meat,” Wild concludes sourly. He pokes at the slate. He’s got milk in there somewhere. The corner of the screen is cracked. He doesn’t think the crack was there a minute ago. Maybe Twilight was right and he shouldn’t have whacked it on the pot. “So what are we gonna eat for dinner, then?”</p><p> </p><p>“Rations,” Twilight says simply. “Whatever’s left. And we pray we get outta these woods soon.”</p><p> </p><p>Wild scoffs again. “I’ve climbed,” he offers. “The fog extends above the canopy. Can’t see nothing.”</p><p> </p><p>Twilight chews his lip. “That’s not normal.”</p><p> </p><p>“Well, when’s anything normal for us?”</p><p> </p><p>“You know,” he muses, “I’m starting to wonder whether we’re in some other era’s version of the Lost—”</p><p> </p><p>Across the clearing, fire lights up in the mist like a beacon. Wind shrieks. </p><p> </p><p>“Give it <em> back!” </em>Legend is screaming.</p><p> </p><p>“You’ll set us all on fire!” Warriors shouts back. “I’m confiscating it!”</p><p> </p><p>“We need water!” Four cries. </p><p> </p><p>Twilight sucks in a breath. “I’d better go check that out,” he says with an apologetic glance at Wild. He vanishes into the mist, which is thickening by the second. </p><p> </p><p>Like icy water, a chill runs down Wild’s spine. He spins. Nobody’s watching him. Why does it feel like somebody is breathing down his neck? Peering at him from the trees? The fire burns hot and gold. Wind shrieks again. </p><p> </p><p>“Why are trees so <em> flammable?” </em>someone shouts.</p><p> </p><p>“Cause they’re made of fucking wood<em>, </em>dipshit!” Legend roars back.</p><p> </p><p>“Water!” says Four again. “Someone get water!”</p><p> </p><p>Something thumps. “Get away from it, Hyrule!” Warriors orders. “You’ll get—”</p><p> </p><p>There’s a fizzing, and Wild tastes magic in the air. Someone yelps. “That didn’t work!” Sky says, a touch panicked. “What do we do now?”</p><p> </p><p>Wild fiddles with his slate. If he could get the cryonis rune to work, maybe—or there’s a blizzard rod somewhere in his—</p><p> </p><p>The screen goes dark. He smacks it against the pot again. Nothing happens. No—no, no, no—His memories are stored in that stupid rock. The last proof he has of Zelda. What is he going to do if—? He sort of wants to cry. </p><p> </p><p>“Legend, you’ve got those medallions, right? What do they do?”</p><p> </p><p>Legend makes a sound that’s halfway between a scream and a bellow. “Explosions! Earthquakes! Lightning!”</p><p> </p><p>“Nothing <em> useful?” </em></p><p> </p><p>“They’re plenty useful! Just not right now!”</p><p> </p><p>“Anyone?” Four asks. “I’ve already poured all our drinking water on it, there’s no more—”</p><p> </p><p>The fire catches a tree and licks at the trunk—the leaves rise up in flames. A crackle, a sharp crack—a branch, coated in tongues of flame, falls out of the sky—</p><p> </p><p>“We’re going to die!” Wind shrieks. Warriors shoves his scarf up over his nose and holds out the dragging end for Wind to do the same. Wild stares at it. The fire sucks in another breath of air and spits back flaming sparks and embers that fly around the clearing, burning in the fog—</p><p> </p><p>A chime sounds.</p><p> </p><p>Wild sneaks a look at the cracked slate in his hands, but the screen is dim and silent. And this can’t be his Slate anyway, his Slate has never made a noise like this—so even and melodic as it rises and falls steadily—</p><p> </p><p>A figure appears amid the ash, surrounded by flame curling across the ground, holding something blue to its mouth. The music sharpens. A trill, and then a high, smooth run.</p><p> </p><p>Wild stares. His pulse thrums in time with the song.</p><p> </p><p>There is a glorious, breathtaking moment of silence, when even the fire seems to pause in its tracks. Twilight’s jaw has dropped. Sky’s face is slack. Legend’s eyes are round as opals.</p><p> </p><p>Then the fog opens, and rain starts to fall.</p><p> </p><p>Wild fell off a cliff once. Well, more than once, but the first time—he’d slipped on a rock still wet from the morning drizzle and slithered right off a ledge into the lake. It’d been a short fall, considering, but it had surprised him. As the air swept past him he’d struggled to take a breath, disorientated, and then the water had met him in a cold, heavy rush. He’d sunk three lengths before he’d realised what was happening. Struggled for the surface with the feeling that the world had just skipped over something. Something in between the climbing and the swimming. It had happened too quickly.</p><p> </p><p>The rain feels like that. Like a bucket dumped over his head. Like falling.</p><p> </p><p>He drops the slate from nerveless fingers and gasps into the shock of it. </p><p> </p><p>“Gods,” he hears someone whisper. </p><p> </p><p>He can still hear the music, floating in the rain, somehow. Like it <em> is </em>the rain. </p><p> </p><p>Water pours down his forehead. He feels a steady stream slide down his nose and scrubs his eyes. His tunic is soaking. The ground is suddenly muddy. Steam is billowing out from the trees. The fire is hissing as it dies. It’s hard to breathe.</p><p> </p><p>Just as Wild’s beginning to think he’s going to drown, the rain stops.</p><p> </p><p>The Chain all heave into the silence, gulping desperate mouthfuls of air. The water streaming from their clothes and hands and hair slow to a trickle, then a steady dripping. It sounds unnaturally loud. Nobody dares speak.</p><p><br />
The steam clears, slowly, outlining the silhouette of a man. Like a glimpse through a crack in the sky. A piece of the sacred realm. A magic so deep and old and musical none of them should have ever witnessed it. The man lowers his hands. An ocarina is tucked comfortably in his palm. It looks unremarkable.</p><p> </p><p>He is dry.</p><p> </p><p>Wild swaps wide-eyed stares with the rest of the Chain. </p><p> </p><p>“The Lost Woods want you to leave,” says the—could he be a mere man? He seems inconceivably old and young all at once. The trees are curled over him as if to offer him shelter. He is plated in gold and far too comfortable in the midst of an unknown group of armed men and impossibly, terrifyingly serene.</p><p> </p><p>“We’ve been trying,” Warriors says, voice smaller than he probably means it to be. He clears his throat. “We haven’t been able to find a way out.”</p><p> </p><p>The man—the distinctly <em> not </em>-man hums. “You’re interrupting the game.”</p><p> </p><p>“The… the game?”</p><p> </p><p>“The kids like to play,” says the not-man, sounding almost <em> normal </em>for a moment. Then he smiles and Wild’s hindbrain shrieks. This is something that dug its way out of the wet earth, he thinks. He bares his teeth.</p><p> </p><p>“If it helps,” Warriors plods on, miserably resigned to being the group’s spokesperson, “we’re here by accident, we don’t mean any harm. Hylia—or <em> someone, </em>at least—dropped us here via a magic portal—”</p><p> </p><p>“Hylia,” says the not-man. He exhales, slowly, in a way that seems deliberate. Like he doesn’t need to, but he is anyway. “I know her trickery well.”</p><p> </p><p>Legend elbows Wild, animosity forgotten. “Did he just admit to<em> knowing a goddess personally?” </em></p><p> </p><p>Wild doesn’t know how to put words to the frantic, curling things inside him. He tries for the soft whining of a surprised fox and hopes that Legend understands.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah,” says the veteran. “Is<em> — </em>is he a…?”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m known as Warriors,” Warriors says, and sticks his hand out gingerly. “This is Wind, Twilight, Wild, Sky, Legend, Four, and Hyrule—I know, like the country. Are you a Link? A… a hero?”</p><p> </p><p>The not-man looks at the proffered hand for a long time, like he can’t remember what to do with it. Eventually he leans forward. Warriors shivers as their skin touches.</p><p> </p><p>“I was,” the not-man says. “Once.”</p><p> </p><p>“So what is he now?” Legend hisses. “Something more?”</p><p> </p><p>Sky makes an odd noise from beside the veteran. “They say in my time some gods are yet to be born.”</p><p> </p><p>“I will lead you,” says the not-man.</p><p> </p><p>“From the woods?” Warriors almost squeaks. “Or the—are you talking about our <em> quest </em>, because—”</p><p> </p><p>“I believe I belong among you,” says the not-man. “I can help.”</p><p> </p><p>Warriors swallows. “You’ll need a name, then. You can’t go by Link, that won’t really… work. In our group.” He waves a vague hand behind him.</p><p> </p><p>The not-man smiles again, ever so measured and careful. He makes a small motion. The shadows begin to rustle. A collection of awful, twisted wooden <em> scarecrows </em>emerge from behind trees and bushes and their own packs to dance in a ring around him. </p><p> </p><p>Wild chokes. Looking at them is like staring into the sun. His head <em> aches. </em>The creatures spin and twirl like mannequins on strings. Their eyes are huge and gold, smiles frozen. He hears gurgling and realises it’s laughter.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re welcome, kids,” says the not-man, amused, with that same small smile. The creatures clack against each other like wind chimes and scamper back into the trees, wobbling on limbs that bend backwards.</p><p> </p><p>“What’s he the god of, do you think?” Legend hisses in Wild’s ear.</p><p> </p><p>“Turning children into horrors,” Wild says back, panicked.</p><p> </p><p>“No, that’s a Lost Woods staple. This guy is something else entirely, I can feel it.”</p><p> </p><p>“Time,” says the not-man. Except it isn’t a <em> statement </em> , it’s a—it’s an <em> introduction. </em>“If I must be named new among you, I believe that will describe my actions satisfactorily.” He smiles. “It fits better than Link, at this point in my life, I think.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, fuck no,” Legend whispers. “No, please tell me we haven’t just stumbled across the cryptid <em> personification of time </em>.”</p><p> </p><p>Hyrule, on Wild’s other side, makes a considering noise. “He might help on our <em> time travelling quest </em>,” he says reasonably.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay,” says Warriors, visibly pulling himself together. “Welcome to the group, Time.”</p><p> </p><p>The not-man nods, once, then runs his blue eye over the group. Wild goes still. The right eye socket is bisected with a scar. Ethereal white light spills from the crack in the eyelid. The markings on his face are not just lines but delicate symbols. His face is lined. </p><p> </p><p>Eternity seems to freeze Wild in place. He feels like the rabbits he skins raw and impales on the cutting board when he makes stew. A breeze passes over him like cold water. He wonders, trembling, whether he is bound for the cookpot. Time’s gaze is heavier than iron.</p><p> </p><p>Then the god shifts, and the moment is broken. Wild notices his slate on the ground and scoops it up with trembling hands. It’s wet from the rain. He wipes it with his sleeve.</p><p> </p><p>The cracks are gone.</p><p> </p><p>What kind of magic song can heal even technology? Wild presses it into his chest and the tunic Zelda made for him. </p><p> </p><p>“Oh, gods,” says Legend.</p><p> </p><p>“This way,” the once-hero, once-Link, god of time tells them all, seeming to approve of what he sees in their souls. “The Lost Woods changes faces often. But I do not lose my way.”</p><p> </p><p>One by one, they follow him into the trees.</p>

    <p> </p><p>On the first night of their new adventure, before they meet the god, the eight of them build a fire in the woods. It burns hot and bright in the relentless fog. The stars are shrouded beyond reach; the air still, the trees calm. They are adrift in history.</p><p> </p><p>“Has anyone ever met giant llama people?” Wild asks, flames casting a bronze shadow across the burn scars on his face.</p><p> </p><p>Warriors straightens slightly, listening as everyone around the circle dissents with varying degrees of incredulity. The man with the blue cap and peach-pink bangs, fingers ringed with gold—the one who immediately called him a prick when Warriors introduced himself as a captain in the Queen’s Army—quirks a crooked eyebrow, as if to say, <em> giant llama people? Can you believe it? </em></p><p> </p><p>Warriors digs his fingernails into his scarred palm. He can’t. Maybe the War was supposed to teach him, and maybe he should be used to stumbling into myths and fairytales, into the past, but he has never been so violently lost before. The fairytales have always come to <em> him, </em>to where he had battalions and generals and marching orders. There have always been expectations.</p><p> </p><p>Now they have no map and no leader and no common Queen to unite them. The sailor is younger, barely more than a preteen, and the masked child is nowhere to be found. The loss is a dull, relentless ache.</p><p> </p><p>“Nobody?” Wild sighs, and flops off his log to land sprawled across the grass. Twilight pokes him with one booted foot and he sticks out his tongue in lazy retaliation.</p><p> </p><p>“Cub, why would we’ve seen giant—whatsit?”</p><p> </p><p>“Llama,” says Wind helpfully.</p><p> </p><p>“Llama people?” Twilight finishes. </p><p> </p><p>“I don’t know,” says Wild. The fire sputters. “There was a Zonai Kingdom, for a while, instead of Hyrule. I’m trying to figure out where I am on the timeline.”</p><p> </p><p>Silence sweeps over their group of eight like winter, swift and cold. The chatter dies down.</p><p> </p><p>“If you don’t know what a llama is, I could show you a picture?” Wild offers.</p><p> </p><p>Warriors pictures Impa, just behind Zelda’s thin shoulder, eyes like carnelians. <em> They say that time was broken, long ago, </em> she rasps in his brain, the echo of her inside him. <em> Something happened—our records are lacking, after hundreds of years. All we know is— </em></p><p> </p><p>“A fracture,” he says aloud.</p><p> </p><p>Everyone turns to him in unison. He shakes Impa away. </p><p> </p><p>“A Sheikah warrior of my time,” he explains, “believed that time used to move in three concurrent rivers. Three parallel timelines, if you will.”</p><p> </p><p>He meets blank stares head-on, lifting his chin and flattening his palms by his side. “Our best guess is that it involved divine intervention of some kind. In the War, we were allied with many powerful mages, including some that could manipulate the flow of time—but none who could break it or split it. A <em> mortal </em>who could do that would be… impossibly powerful.”</p><p> </p><p>“Three timelines…” Four breathes. His name has been easy for Warriors to remember—chiefly because it makes the least amount of sense. “Oh, the implications…”</p><p> </p><p>“I know I’m after you,” says the young brown-haired boy that has been hovering around the edges of the group since they met. Warriors follows his dark-eyed gaze across the clearing. </p><p> </p><p>It lands on the man with the blue cap, who lifts his head. </p><p> </p><p>“Me?” he asks. His voice sounds alien without the bitter edge colouring the words.</p><p> </p><p>“The Hero of Legend,” the boy breathes. He moves closer. Everyone in the camp settles. “You’re a story.”</p><p> </p><p>Legend barks a short laugh. “I suppose it would’ve been too much to hope that Ganon would stay dead.”</p><p> </p><p>The boy shakes his head. What was his name? Why can’t Warriors remember? “He did,” he insists. “For so long that we forgot to watch for him in the night.”</p><p> </p><p>Legend suddenly looks like a man drowning. The boy reaches out, fingers light, as if to touch a monument. </p><p> </p><p>Warriors watches them. The boy’s hand curls into Legend’s fingers and the blue-capped hero shudders soundlessly. What does it feel like to hold history in the palm of your hand? What does it feel like to hold the future? </p><p> </p><p>The silence stretches on, and neither of them let go.</p><p> </p><p>“You must live in an era after mine,” Twilight says to Wild. The moment shatters. The nameless boy retreats. “That slate is like no technology I’ve ever seen before.”</p><p> </p><p>“Who’s before me, then?”</p><p> </p><p>“I know who’s before me,” Wind offers. Warriors glances at him briefly. </p><p> </p><p>It was strange having to introduce himself to his own brother. He observes from a careful distance the baby fat in Wind’s cheeks, seeing the places where it will thin and where the bone structure of his jawline will emerge. </p><p> </p><p>“Who?” Sky asks.</p><p> </p><p>Wind leans forward, ushering them closer, as if he’s about to tell a secret. Warriors leans in despite himself. The kid had always been charismatic; a storyteller. The memories of his brother are plastered on top of this foreign young version despite all efforts to redirect his thinking. A living ghost, who gets pissed off more often than amused and whose blond hair is curlier than Warriors ever saw it.</p><p> </p><p>“The Hero of Time,” the sailor says. His voice comes like a breath of wind. They collectively shiver. The Hero of Time is a boogeyman; a wraith. Something that lurks around the edges of every story.</p><p> </p><p>Mist envelopes them. Warriors glances back at the pale trees, but they are alone.</p><p> </p><p>“I met his ghost, once,” Twilight says. “Or spirit? I couldn’t tell.”</p><p> </p><p>“Wait, the Hero of Time?” Legend asks. </p><p> </p><p>Wind nods, and wiggles his fingers mock-spookily. “They called me the Hero of Time Reborn, but that wasn’t true. I didn’t have the right spirit. He saved the world, then vanished, and the goddesses sent the flood…”</p><p> </p><p>“But he died,” Legend says.</p><p> </p><p>Everyone stills. </p><p> </p><p>“Three timelines,” Four remembers. “Have you heard of him, Sky?” </p><p> </p><p>The Skyloftian shakes his head. A huge piece of thin silky fabric is folded up and tucked like a cape on his back. Warriors caught glimpses of pale blue embroidery earlier when he bent down to retrieve a whittling knife from his pack—he carves a chunk of firewood idly as they talk. “All the records of the time before the Chaos Wars have been lost entirely,” he says. “But I suppose it’s feasible.”</p><p> </p><p>“Has anyone here heard of the Chaos Wars?” Four asks. “No?”</p><p> </p><p>“Maybe I’m at the end of the timeline, then,” Sky says. He peels another strip of wood from the block. What is he making? “The Chaos Wars were… you would have heard of them, if they’d happened in your past. They were…”</p><p> </p><p>“I’ve heard of a few wars,” Wild says. “But not that one.” </p><p> </p><p>Warriors tenses. “One of those might’ve been mine.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah,” Wild says. He blinks. It seems purposeful, like he might’ve forgotten earlier and was making up for it now. His irises are almost electric blue. The same colour as his slate, Warriors realises. It’s offputting. “I think it was.”</p><p> </p><p>“So that gives us our three rivers of time that converge,” Four tells them. He picks up a stick from their pile of firewood and digs it into the ground. Soft dark earth is overturned as he draws. “One river for the sailor, one for the veteran and the traveller and the rancher, and one for—? Me, maybe?”</p><p> </p><p>“Is the rancher after or before the traveller and veteran?” Sky asks thoughtfully.</p><p> </p><p>Four shrugs. Warriors bites the inside of his lip. The <em> traveller. </em>Hyrule. That was the boy’s name. Was he one of the heroes depicted in the Temple of Souls? Should Warriors be ashamed that he doesn’t know more of his own history? Cia’s obsession had been hard to face, even after she was defeated. He’d tried not to look any of the statues in the eyes.</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t know much of history,” Twilight says apologetically. “My village has been farming land for centuries.”</p><p> </p><p>“There are no farmlands anymore,” says Hyrule. “But I haven’t heard of you.” </p><p> </p><p>“Does that mean it goes rancher, veteran, traveller?” Four asks.</p><p> </p><p>“No,” says Legend. “The Hero of Time came directly before me. There’s a grave in Hyrule Field that’s only a couple of decades old.”</p><p> </p><p>“This doesn’t make sense,” Twilight says.</p><p> </p><p>“You must be from parallel worlds, then,” Four says. </p><p> </p><p>“He’s the third river,” Legend realises.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes. And then we have our captain,” Four says decisively. The tip of the stick hovers over the diagram, before he extends each of the lines. He jabs the stick down sharply to create a point at which they all meet. “You knew about all three of the branches,” he continues. “You must be the future of all of them. And after you, the cook.”</p><p> </p><p>Wind cranes his neck to look at the diagram. “What about you?” </p><p> </p><p>Four chews the inside of his mouth for a moment. “I… haven’t heard of anyone else,” he admits. “Maybe I’m here?” He points at the third timeline, after the mark representing Twilight. “Or I could be here.” </p><p> </p><p>The stick moves to the line between Warriors and Wild. “This has to be a long time,” he says, “because none of us have heard of the Zonai. And Wild’s technology is so complex.”</p><p> </p><p>Wind snorts. “It can’t be <em> that </em> advanced,” he says. “In my time, the old pirates say there’s a land to the west where the people ride around in machines on rails.”</p><p> </p><p>“What about after Wild and before Sky?” Twilight offers.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, that could make sense,” Wild agrees. “A lot of our oral history was destroyed when… well, we still have records, but it’s not uncommon to find small settlements that are mostly cut off from the wider world.”</p><p> </p><p>“Okay.” Four tosses the stick into the fire and leans over his drawing. “There. That’s all eight of us.”</p><p> </p><p>“And the Hero of Time,” Twilight points out. The fire crackles. “He’s at the top. The beginning of the world.”</p><p> </p><p>“He must have split the timelines,” Legend murmurs. Hyrule drifts closer, peering over his shoulder.</p><p> </p><p>“I thought you said a mortal couldn’t do that,” Sky says.</p><p> </p><p>Impa’s eyes, like carnelians. <em> They say that time was broken, long ago. </em></p><p> </p><p>“Maybe I was wrong,” Warriors says aloud. “Or… maybe I wasn’t.”</p><p> </p><p>Beside the fire, Wind shivers.</p><p> </p><p>He has to say something.</p><p> </p><p>“In the war,” Warriors starts, watching them turn towards him like the battlefield crows to carrion; like men to the blade that brings their deaths: “I met other heroes from other times. One of them was a child.”</p><p> </p><p>“You let a child fight in a <em> war?” </em>Legend snaps.</p><p> </p><p>Twilight’s brow creases.</p><p> </p><p>“I had no choice,” Warriors says, and begins to laugh. “He was more powerful than I was and didn’t take no for an answer. I sent him away, I gave him errands, I assigned soldiers to watch him. He slipped them all. On the battlefield…”</p><p> </p><p>He swallows.</p><p> </p><p>“He carried masks,” he continues, forcing the words out. “The masks… changed him. Allowed him to take the shape of other creatures.”</p><p> </p><p>Wild makes a curious noise.</p><p> </p><p>“One was more powerful than the rest. A hylian face—or, it <em> looked </em>hylian. When he wore it… he was taller than two men stacked. There were coloured tattoos on his face. His skin was… leeched of colour. Eyes went white.”</p><p> </p><p>Warriors hides his shaking hands in his scarf. He’d slipped on a corpse and fallen. A moblin had decided to take the opportunity to skewer him. It hadn’t been the first time he’d known with cold, detached clarity that he was about to die, but it had been one of the worst.</p><p> </p><p>Then the silver double helix had come down like a bolt of lightning on the moblin, splitting apart the bone of its skull easier than Warriors shelled peanuts. The giant had tilted his head and <em> looked </em>at him cowering in the mud. Eyes blank. Eerily silent. He hadn’t known it was the child, underneath, back then. He’d thought it was some sort of angel. The giant stood alone on the battlefield, like a pillar in the grey rain, while soldiers scrambled for their swords.</p><p> </p><p><em> Stand down, </em> Warriors had managed through a broken rib, before they carried him away. <em> He’s an ally. </em></p><p> </p><p>“The child was a hero in his own right.” He clears his throat. “But the mask… he didn’t like to talk about it. He wouldn’t tell me where it came from or how he got a hold on it.”</p><p> </p><p>“But you think you know?” Legend says, eyes glittering. He leans in closer, eyebrows furrowed.</p><p> </p><p>Warriors swallows. “I think I do,” he agrees. “The child mentioned a town of clocks, once, when he was half-asleep. And he used to flinch when Impa spoke of the splitting of the timeline—he was very sensitive to discussions of history. He told me the mask was modelled from the body of a great warrior.”</p><p> </p><p>“You think it was modelled off the Hero of Time,” Legend finished.</p><p> </p><p>“It could be,” Four mused. “Most gods have true forms. And shape like that has power.”</p><p> </p><p>“Do you think he’ll join us on this adventure?” Twilight wonders.</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t know,” Warriors says. He buries the child’s echo again in the hollow recesses of his memory. The laughter, the pranks, the late nights exchanging insults and trivia—they belong with the sailor’s older self, not here by the fireside surrounded by strangers. He flicks his gaze over Wind. “You would’ve liked Mask, by the way.”</p><p> </p><p>“Maybe he’ll join us,” says his brother who is no longer his brother.</p><p> </p><p>“Maybe,” lies Warriors. He aches to reach out and ruffle the kid’s hair. He never expected to see the sailor again after the War, but the pang in his heart is bittersweet. “It's an impossible conjecture. The Hero of Time could be anyone.”</p><p> </p><p>“More of a myth than a man,” Sky agrees. He yawns. The wood in his hands is taking on the shape of a bird. “If he ever existed at all.”</p><p> </p><p>“Someone must’ve died using his name,” Legend says, his face awash in shadow. “Or Ganon wouldn’t have tried to kill me when I was a kid.”</p><p><br />
<br />
</p><p> </p><hr /><p> </p><p><br />
<br />
</p><p>It is not a hero’s right to question the gods. </p><p> </p><p>Link—Time, now—emerges from the portal, and shakes off the eddies of thick, buzzing energy that cling to his armour. He can taste Hylia’s brand of divinity on the back of his tongue. It’s icy and sweet and familiar. He almost feels the phantom sensation of the ocarina in his palms. </p><p> </p><p>The strange men are waiting for him on the other side. If they can be called men<em> . </em></p><p> </p><p>It had been a shock, at first, to hear them introduce themselves. <em> I’m known as Warriors, </em> the creature holding out his hand in hylian greeting fashion had said. <em> This is Wind… </em>His skin was warm. It was strange. Time has never been allowed to touch a god before. What a sight they had made in the Lost Woods, all eight of them surrounded by great coils of magic, pulsing through them and around them. It had taken all he had not to clam up like a child when they said he was welcome in their group. </p><p> </p><p>A man walking among immortals. Malon is not going to <em> believe </em>this.</p><p> </p><p>The one he shook hands with is representative of warriors. Fitting, then, that he wears a similar-looking pauldron as the young captain from Time’s childhood, whose face and voice is now lost to his fading memory. The others range from gleeful to surly, but each of them have a facade of youth. The Wind has taken the shape of a <em> boy, </em>for Nayru’s sake: as playful and impulsive as the element he is made of. It is absurd to realise Time appears to be the eldest of them.</p><p> </p><p>Time squints into the afternoon sun and the battlements around. They’ve arrived in a courtyard, paved with diamonds. The shapes tease… He’s been to this place, long ago. It’s familiar.</p><p> </p><p>“Ooh, this is Warriors’ <em> least </em>favourite Hyrule,” the child-shaped god says cheerfully. </p><p> </p><p>“Is not,” Warriors grumbles. “That’d make me a traitor.”</p><p> </p><p>“You flinched when you recognised it,” another of the group points out. This god—<em>Legend, </em>a creature of storytelling—has little furrows in his forehead. It’s so realistic.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, because I don’t want whatever we’re fighting on this quest to be <em> here. </em>Where all these poor souls finally found peace.”</p><p> </p><p>“Mm,” says Sky. </p><p> </p><p>Hyrule sighs. “Okay, that’s fair.”</p><p> </p><p>Time suppresses a wide-eyed stare. He still can’t believe… He catches two of the others looking at him intently and tilts his head in their direction. They glance away.</p><p> </p><p>“Let’s head for the Castle’s inner circle,” Warriors decides. “We can get advice from the Queen’s court.”</p><p> </p><p>“You just miss your soldier friends, I bet,” the Wind teases.</p><p> </p><p>Warriors shoots him an awkward glance. Time imagines him watching over the armies during times of bloodshed. Does he often walk among them disguised as a common soldier? Do they know him for what he truly is?</p><p> </p><p>Did he ever meet Time’s older brothers? This is the land his eldest brother was born in—the same castle and battlegrounds and sun glinting off metal. And Time has travelled through an odd portal to get here, the same as last time. This place must be a long way away, he considers, not for the first time. He’d checked the maps when he got home from the war as a kid and couldn’t find the battleground he’d fought at on any single one. A long, <em> long </em>distance, if they must resort to some kind of teleportation magic to arrive despite Twilight owning a horse. </p><p> </p><p>But then he had never been able to find Termina on any map either. Nor been able to lead Epona there. </p><p> </p><p>And why does the magic so clearly come from Hylia? Could none of the gods use their own? He worries his lip and glances at Hyrule—at the personification of his <em> country. </em> There are glittery wings in the shadow he casts—faint, but distinct, if you know where to look. He smells like fairies. He smells like fairies even more than <em> Time </em>smells like fairies, despite the fact that the way Malon’s friends tell it, he’s more than half a fairy himself. Changeling, they call him. It pales next to Hyrule’s flower-sweet coils of magic. </p><p> </p><p>Is there a reason he’s not using his own power? They said that Hylia had sent them on a mission. Is that it? Is there something wrong with—?</p><p> </p><p>Warriors leads them up a long hallway. They pass a brazier set into the wall and a vague memory stirs within him. Being a child, and running—running to the hiding-place he’d found a week before. The young captain hot on his heels, brandishing a chuchu-jelly-filled boot. And the sailor, his other older brother, cackling in delight from the other side of the hall where the Wind is now standing. </p><p> </p><p>“This way is quicker,” he says, and fiddles with the brazier until the fastening <em> clicks </em>and with the slide of smooth stone, a passage is revealed.</p><p> </p><p>“How did you—How did you <em> know </em>that?” Twilight’s eyes are wide.</p><p> </p><p>Time frowns. “I’ve been here before.”</p><p> </p><p>“Really?” the Sky asks. Time doesn’t know why he looks so surprised. The Sky is boundless and endless and forever. Surely he has seen things Time could hardly dream of?</p><p> </p><p>“Is that surprising?” he returns. “It’s not that far.”</p><p> </p><p>The people speak the same language, at least. And the same words are important. Crowns and swords and a queen dressed as a Sheikah. </p><p> </p><p>“No-o,” Wind tells him after a beat. “I guess not, for you.”</p><p> </p><p>“Does this mean we were wrong about the timeline?” one of them hisses. “Is Warriors’ era more ancient than we thought?”</p><p> </p><p>“It can’t be,” Four says back. “Time just must be… well.”</p><p> </p><p>Timelines? Did he hear that correctly? Malon’s been telling him recently that his ears are getting worse. He fingers the ocarina in its pouch on his belt. He hasn’t played the Song of Time in decades. He’s not sure he would remember how it goes if it weren’t for the fact that sometimes he comes into the kitchen and Malon is humming it under her breath, and every so often the scarecrows in the fields will sing it to him instead of the <em> doh-doh-doh-doh-doh </em>he teaches them. Sometimes, when the north wind rolls down into the valley, it drifts in the air like a distant voice. Time—the concept—meanders on with every moment. It follows him around. </p><p> </p><p>“This <em> is </em>a shortcut,” Warriors frowns. “I recognise these walls. This is the back of the council chambers.”</p><p> </p><p>Time doesn’t say <em> I told you so, </em>because that would be rude. But he lifts one corner of his mouth. </p><p> </p><p>They exit the passageway in single file. Warriors’ eyes run over Time twice, solemn, before he throws open the heavyset oak door and steps briskly inside. His boots echo on the polished stone floor.</p><p> </p><p>The conversation inside sputters and dies. The councillors watch the group of gods—and one mortal man—as they approach the end of the table and the familiar woman sitting there.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re back quickly,” the queen observes.</p><p> </p><p>“Your majesty,” Warriors says, and inclines his head. He presses his lips to her gloved hand. Zelda—for she <em> must </em> be a Zelda, a daughter of the Zelda that Time knew ruled this land as a child, perhaps, too young to be the original—smiles. Time stares. She must—she can’t <em> not </em>know that the creature bowing to her is a god. Why does he do it? To blend in? Does he enjoy playacting? </p><p> </p><p>Is this how the War was won? With the patronage of a god?</p><p> </p><p>“I am glad you have returned so promptly,” Zelda tells him. “We were not expecting you back for a number of years. We have much to discuss.”</p><p> </p><p>“Years?” Warriors brow furrows. “How long has it been?” His gaze flicks sideways to Time.</p><p> </p><p>“Seven months,” says the queen simply. “For you?”</p><p> </p><p>“A little over three weeks.”</p><p> </p><p>“Interesting. I assume you were displaced in time?”</p><p> </p><p>“Lost,” Warriors clarifies. “But we were found again.” Again, his face shifts. “Your highness, may I introduce my companions. You are aware of the problems we came across during the war with my—er, namesakes.”</p><p> </p><p>Fellow gods, he means. Is he confuscating the matter for the benefit of the councillors? Can they not taste the power on him?</p><p> </p><p>“I give you Wind, Sky, Hyrule, Twilight, Four, Wild, Legend and Time.”</p><p> </p><p>The queen surveys them with ice-blue eyes. “All of them like you?”</p><p> </p><p>Time feels eyes upon his back. He knows he is the odd man out. He does not mind it. </p><p> </p><p>“Time…” Warriors begins. “He says… He says he was once a Link, but…”</p><p> </p><p>Once a Link. Now a farmer. Now Malon’s husband. Now retired—or should be.</p><p> </p><p>“He believes Hylia wants him on this quest. You must recognise his likeness.”</p><p> </p><p>“I see,” says the queen, slowly. </p><p> </p><p>His likeness? Time frowns to himself. Could his reputation as a hero have spread so far that it somehow reached this distant land? </p><p> </p><p>“Do you require anything… Time?” Zelda asks.</p><p> </p><p>He loosens his tongue hastily from where it has been glued to the roof of his mouth. “Your audience is reward enough for now,” he says, in some awkward semblance of courtly manners. He has never been silver-tongued. That was always the Captain, he remembers. All those years ago. How old would the man be now? Fifty? How old would the Zelda he fought beside be? The one who dressed as Sheik, like an echo of his own princess? “Though it would please me greatly to know your mother is well. She was an admirable warrior in her time.”</p><p> </p><p>There are faint murmurs behind him.</p><p> </p><p>“You are kind,” Zelda observes. The gold on her uniform shines. She wears a filigree circlet rather than a traditional crown. “Strange. I have not heard time to be so.”</p><p> </p><p>She leans forward.</p><p> </p><p>“Then again,” she says, as he wonders what in the sacred realm she is talking about— “I have also heard that time heals all wounds. My mother is long dead.”</p><p> </p><p>Her gaze lingers on the right side of his face. He fights the urge to open his eye. A dull ache sinks deeply into his heart—grief for a woman whose face he cannot remember.</p><p> </p><p>“Maybe the time you are looking for has not yet passed,” he offers, clumsy.</p><p> </p><p>“You are right,” Zelda says graciously. “Please, be seated. I would be interested to see what you make of this.”</p><p> </p><p>The councillors closest to them spring to their feet, stammering about temples. Zelda waves the group forward and servants rush to tuck their chairs in for them, then flee. </p><p> </p><p>“What is going on?” Warriors breathes. He picks up a large document. “The treaty… this should be in the Great Hall. It marks the beginning of a new era of peace. What is it doing here?”</p><p> </p><p>“It is an era of peace that might be shorter than we hoped,” Zelda admits. “Dissent is gathering. There have been skirmishes on the border. We are preparing for another war.”</p><p> </p><p>Warriors makes a face like he’s been punched. “No,” he breathes. “No… the kingdom barely survived the last one. I…”</p><p> </p><p>Does it drain his power, Time wonders, to watch soldiers die? Did he watch Time’s older brother die? Did he cradle his ghost, and tell him that everything would be okay?</p><p> </p><p>He knows with every bone in his body that the captain had been a war hero. If he had survived, he should be in this council chamber, advising Zelda on behalf of her late mother. The sailor belonged to the ocean, and Time will not begrudge an old man his wanderlust—but the captain should have been here, at the queen’s right hand side. </p><p> </p><p>None of the elders in this room have eyes in the right shade of blue. </p><p> </p><p>“I admit, we do not have the finances,” Zelda says. For a moment she sounds so deeply <em> tired </em>that Time wishes to offer her comfort. But what could he say? “The monsters are stirring. They are no longer content to remain in their own territories. There are reports of raids. Trinity Village went up in flames two months ago.”</p><p> </p><p>“Trinity…” Warriors echoes. “But that’s nowhere near the Gate of Souls and the main battlefields. If there is another being collecting power, why is it reaching so far east? Trinity was untouched by the war.”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t know,” Zelda confides. “All attempts at gathering intel have been unsuccessful. The most we have been able to glean is that the monsters are all passing around news of a humanoid creature. Moderate height, close enough to hylian to be labelled as such at a glance, described as a living shadow. So somebody, at least, is directing them.”</p><p> </p><p>“A living shadow…” Four speaks up. “I’ve encountered something similar before.”</p><p> </p><p>“As have I,” Warriors admits.</p><p> </p><p>“And I,” says Hyrule.</p><p> </p><p>“And I,” says Time. Thick, cloying silence floods the room suddenly. Everyone is looking at him.</p><p> </p><p>“A dark god,” Zelda says slowly. Another thing he doesn’t understand. “Tell us. Will there be another war?”</p><p> </p><p>Time looks around the room. The councillors are staring. The gods are arrayed in an uneven cluster behind him, a mixture of concerned and entertained. Warriors is quiet. Zelda is wide-eyed. There is so much <em> hope </em>in her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>She is slightly older than he ever knew her mother to be, he thinks. The gold glints on her breastplate. But as old as she gets, she will never be prepared for a war. There is no preparation possible.</p><p> </p><p>Why is she asking <em> him? </em></p><p> </p><p>He clears his throat and says the first words that appear on his tongue. “Only when Warriors ceases to care for this kingdom.” The god was her patron, right? </p><p> </p><p>The murmurs pick up again.</p><p> </p><p>“What does that mean?” Zelda demands. “When he ceases to care… when will he? What do you know?”</p><p> </p><p>“Your majesty,” Warriors says, pale-knuckled. “Don’t push him.”</p><p> </p><p>“You can’t be a traitor,” she says fiercely. “You <em> can’t.” </em></p><p> </p><p>Time has said something wrong. He can’t tell what.</p><p> </p><p>“I pledged myself to you, your majesty,” Warriors says. His tone is unnaturally subservient. It makes Time’s gut clench. Something is wrong here. “I have no intention of breaking that pledge. You have to believe—I <em> implore </em>you…”</p><p> </p><p>“I do,” she tells him. “I do. I <em> do.”  </em>But she taps her fingers anxiously against the table as she says the words.</p><p> </p><p>“It would be unwise to stand against divine word,” says one of the councillors. </p><p> </p><p>“What do you propose?” the queen asks, quiet. </p><p> </p><p>Warriors lifts his chin as the room’s focus shifts to him. His face is ashen. What is happening? </p><p> </p><p>“Your majesty, you know how we treat traitors to the crown,” growls one of the advisors.</p><p> </p><p>“That was during <em> wartime,” </em>another one speaks up. “It would be illegal—no, downright inhumane to inflict that in these times—”</p><p> </p><p>“He is only a suspected traitor,” another corrects, side-eyeing Time. “Nothing has been proven.”</p><p> </p><p>“Immortal foreknowledge will be admitted in a court of law!”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s not any worse than what he carried out with his own two hands,” one of them points out. He’s white-haired around the temples and wearing a badge pinned to his robes wrought in the shape of a flower. “More than two hundred of our own former men, dead at his hands. I saw it. He’s always been a risk. Anyone else would’ve snapped.”</p><p> </p><p>Warriors’ mouth is pressed in a thin line. Time tries to imagine him on the battlefields of his childhood. A vengeful god. How had they never met, back then? The Deity barely let Time walk away from any battle, no matter how tired he grew.</p><p> </p><p>“I will accept whatever consequences the state deems fit,” Warriors says.</p><p> </p><p>“Hush,” the queen tells him. Time doesn’t—he doesn’t understand. How can they sit at their table and threaten a <em> god? </em> Command a <em> god? </em>Is he bound in service to the crown in some way? Do gods have to follow the same rules that the fairies and the children do? </p><p> </p><p>Time swallows. Does the council know Warriors’ true name?</p><p> </p><p>Is that why he never saw the god during the war? Did the council keep him separated from the people like a chained dog?</p><p> </p><p>“You can’t do this,” barks Legend from behind. “Look at him. I’ll bet everything he ever did was for you, so you could laze around on that throne debating who lives and dies. More than two hundred dead, you said? Were you the one that gave that order? Is that why you remember it so clearly?”</p><p> </p><p>Muttering breaks out. The councillors begin to bicker.</p><p> </p><p>“I won’t let you scapegoat him because of a <em> possibility,” </em>Legend continues. “You’ve been on the brink of war for months, and he hasn’t been here.”</p><p> </p><p>The words clear a haze from Time’s mind. The councillors think that—? No. No, that’s not what he meant at all—</p><p> </p><p>“Your current problems are no fault of his own,” he says suddenly.</p><p> </p><p>The room settles.</p><p> </p><p>“But they <em> will </em>be?” one of the councillors asks, suspicious.</p><p> </p><p>“I cannot say for certain,” Time says, instead of screaming, <em> why in the name of everything holy are you asking me? </em>He blinks. “The flow of time may take many paths.”</p><p> </p><p>Warriors shoots him a small glance. Gratitude wobbles at the edge of his mouth.</p><p> </p><p>“I still say we should schedule an execution,” someone grumbles. “To be on the safe side.” </p><p> </p><p>Warriors shivers, the movement miniscule and controlled. Can you kill a god with a humble axe? Or would it simply wound? </p><p> </p><p>Unless he is, truly, <em> bound </em>—</p><p> </p><p>“Then he won’t be continuing to care for his kingdom, will he?”</p><p> </p><p>“What, so by your definition the minute he dies, war will erupt? That doesn’t make sense.”</p><p> </p><p>It is possible to kill a god, Time knows. When he closes his eye, he’s still counting—<em> twenty-four, twenty-three, twenty-two. </em>Majora dances on the roof of the tower, wearing the Skull Kid’s wooden body like an ill-fitting costume. You can kill a god, if you try hard enough. If you’re lucky. If you count, very carefully, from four thousand, three hundred, and twenty minutes down to zero.</p><p> </p><p>Hylians melt into poes, when they die. Where do the dead gods go?</p><p> </p><p><em> “Enough,” </em>Queen Zelda snaps. She lifts a gloved hand. “I hear a knock.”</p><p> </p><p>Time flicks his ears. The second time, they all hear it.</p><p> </p><p>“Enter,” Zelda calls.</p><p> </p><p>A thin figure, cloaked in white and indigo, hurries into the room and leans back against the door to close it. She tucks a long piece of blue hair behind her ear. Time’s eyes widen. She is thrumming with magic. The same sort of magic as the ocarina. She smells like the transportation portal he walked through to get to this land.</p><p> </p><p>“Sorceress Lana,” the queen greets.</p><p> </p><p>Not another god, then.</p><p> </p><p>“I saw him,” Lana gasps against the doors. Her eyes pass over the gods, lingering on Warriors, and fix themselves to Time’s face. “I saw the creature we have been searching for.”</p><p> </p><p>Zelda leans forward. “You did? Quick, a description—before he fades from your memory. Scribe!”</p><p> </p><p>Lana has not blinked. “My queen,” she says more slowly, still locking gazes with Time. She smells like the transportation portal. She smells like the ocarina<em> . </em></p><p> </p><p>The ocarina smells like the <em> transportation portal. </em></p><p> </p><p>“I don’t believe there’s any need for scribes and sketches,” Lana says. She lifts a shaky hand and points, index finger lined up with Time’s heart. “The monster was a perfect match for this man.”</p><p> </p><p>“He is no man,” the queen says. What is that supposed to mean? Time doesn’t have the <em> best </em>gasp of hylian gender, but he’s pretty sure he’s not a woman.</p><p> </p><p>Wait.</p><p> </p><p>He stands up. </p><p> </p><p>“Exactly like me?” he clarifies.</p><p> </p><p>“Dead ringer,” Lana says. She looks at Warriors for a moment. “I’ve seen <em> his </em>living shadow before. It wasn’t that.”</p><p> </p><p>“I believe you,” Time tells her. He shifts. His feet itch. He wants to pace. “I know him. I have fought him… a very long time ago.”</p><p> </p><p>He’d been nine. Or sixteen. Or both, or neither—it had stopped mattering so much. <em> You must conquer yourself, </em> Navi had said.</p><p> </p><p>The council exchanges worried glances. The gods murmur among themselves.</p><p> </p><p>He clenches his fists. “I… do not recommend… It would not be wise. To confront him head on. I do not wish to waste your army.”</p><p> </p><p>Could he do it again? Confront the monster face to face? It has been a long time since he fought anything greater than a moblin. </p><p> </p><p>“We will help,” he says. “He will chase me, if I run. He has always chased me.”</p><p> </p><p>What else could a shadow do?</p><p> </p><p>“If he is the cause of your political unrest,” Time continues, “I can’t promise it will fade. But if we travel through a portal, and he follows…”</p><p> </p><p>“That will buy us time,” Zelda finishes. She watches him, quiet. “It’s a good plan.”</p><p> </p><p>It will buy them time. Because they aren’t just transportation portals. They smell of the same magic as the ocarina. This is why the gods are relying on Hylia to create their portals; why Hyrule doesn’t make them himself. Some call her the Goddess of—</p><p> </p><p>They are ruptures in history. They are gaps in <em> time. </em></p><p> </p><p>“So we flee?” Twilight asks.</p><p> </p><p>Time bites his tongue. “We avoid,” he corrects. “For now. Planning ahead saves lives.”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t like it,” Legend says.</p><p> </p><p>“A dark god,” Wind counters cheerfully. Time’s shadow is no god, but he has other things to worry about.</p><p> </p><p>“That one should stay here,” one of the councillors tries, nodding towards Warriors.</p><p> </p><p>Lana snorts. “What’d he do now? Blow his nose too loudly for you <em> gentleman? </em>”</p><p> </p><p>“We have been gifted divine prophecy naming him—”</p><p> </p><p>“A traitor?” she guesses. The corner of her mouth twists upwards. “Oh, I can’t <em> wait </em>for him to snap. I’m counting on it.”</p><p> </p><p>Warriors’ breath stutters. Zelda mouths, <em> go! </em>Time ushers the group out into the corridor as the council erupts into debate.</p><p> </p><p>“Y’know what?” Legend sighs into the hair stuck to the corner of his mouth. “You can mark this down as my least favourite Hyrule, too.”</p><p> </p>

    <p> </p><p>“Mine,” hisses Wild, as the portal collapses into itself behind them, a spectacle in its own right, dying in a wave of purple-black sparks. “Mine…”</p><p> </p><p>“Your what?” the god of legends complains. “Your little wilderness? This isn’t a game of mix and match. Time travel just got officially <em> confirmed </em>—” </p><p> </p><p>He shoots a glance at Time. </p><p> </p><p>“We could be anywhere. This might not even be any of ours.”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s in the air,” Wild snaps back at him, and promptly scarpers. They all scramble after him, fetching bags and boots and swords that were tossed aside with the portal. There’s an arched stone wall up ahead, lichen-infected and crumbling, and it stands alone among the trees like a… like an entrance to something. A gateway. A flock of startled ravens the size of big black dogs take flight as they approach. A conspiracy, as Malon likes to call them.</p><p> </p><p>Time travel. <em> Time travel. </em> Time’s head is still reeling. So the other gods come from different eras? Different versions of Hyrule? No wonder they seemed so unfamiliar with his brothers’ Castle and Queen. </p><p> </p><p>He bites his lip. </p><p> </p><p>Was that time travel, too? His brothers’ Hyrule Castle, ruled by a Queen Zelda, fighting a war that he had never been able to find on a map? There’s a sick sort of dread pooling in the bottom of his lungs. Has he been separated from his brothers not by oceans but by <em> time? </em>All these long years? Has the ghost of that unfindable place been inside his own maps all along? Has he been walking on long-forgotten battlefields his whole life? Has he been treading down the graves of men he fought shoulder to shoulder with?</p><p> </p><p>“Time,” Wind complains. “Wild’s being evasive again. Do <em> you </em>know where we are?”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not being <em> evasive!” </em> Wild yells. “This is <em> mine.” </em></p><p> </p><p>“And how do you <em> know that?” </em></p><p> </p><p>“Settle down,” Time says, like he’s dreaming, like he’s going to wake up into a life where the bones of his brothers haven’t been lost in the dirt under his feet for—it must be centuries. Centuries.</p><p> </p><p>He finds in that single moment he never really believed they could have died.</p><p> </p><p>“Can’t we have just a minute to sit down?” Sky puffs. “Warriors’ guards just chased us down half the citadel.”</p><p> </p><p>They had always been so—so <em> real. </em> In the council chambers he half-expected them to come waltzing in unannounced. In the kitchen at home, rolling out dough, he thinks of them fondly; blond hair in the marketplace turns his head, stops his heart. He knew better than to think he would find them again but still he hoped. As with every piece of his past. He is no good at accepting lost things—maybe, he has always dared to think. Maybe. Malon keeps plates of sugar water on the stiles for his sake. On the windowsills there are candle-stubs in jars, ever-burning. <em> We’re here, I’m here, you’re home.  </em></p><p> </p><p>His brothers will never find him.</p><p> </p><p>“Smell,” Wild says. <em> “Smell.” </em></p><p> </p><p>Time inhales and the wood-sweet smell of the Lost Woods hits him like a boulder to the skull. This new grief slips away out of reach, out of words. It leaves a shadow in its wake. He knows more than feels that his eyes have gone wild. Fairy eyes, Malon calls them, whenever the wind carries an unexpected note of spring, or when the dusk creeps upon him unawares while he’s working. It’s a rush. </p><p> </p><p>The Lost Woods look different. Something in the colour of the trees, the shape of the wind as it curls around them, slow and thick. Leaves rustle like the feathers of a slumbering beast. The grass is longer but thinner, wetter like this new world is suspended in a state of sunshowers and dew. Which god is responsible for this? For this evolution? Throughout all his life, the Lost Woods has never changed, not a breath of new air nor an invasive plant nor a new species of frog. At the wood’s heart, where time holds still, not even the trees grow. Every blade of grass and twig and flower remains exactly where it always was, when he was nine and seven and three. The Lost Woods has never changed in all his life. He thought that meant they never would. </p><p> </p><p>He thought a lot of things.</p><p> </p><p>“It would be wise to—”</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t attempt to tell me what—”</p><p> </p><p>“Well, how many—did <em> you </em>go on, huh? Yeah? That’s what I thought—”</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t get all high and m—”</p><p> </p><p>The gods are arguing. </p><p> </p><p>He takes a step forward. </p><p> </p><p>The easy way leads deeper, to the heart, the places he cannot find again and will lose himself trying. He knows this. He <em> knows. </em>But his heart wishes—there is an ache, deep inside him, an ache that has always been there all his life. And there is only one god that could be responsible for this. One being.</p><p> </p><p>“Uh, Time?”</p><p> </p><p>“He’s… he’s like, wandering away—what’s happening—?”</p><p> </p><p>“Time? Where are you going?”</p><p> </p><p>“I need to see him again,” the words come, almost without him meaning to let them. “I need to. He will have our answers.”</p><p> </p><p>“Do you want Wild to lead you in, then?” the god of Four, whatever that means, speaks up. “He’s done this before.”</p><p> </p><p>“There’s a trick to it,” Wild offers, already fiddling with his curious patterned machine. Metal and glass. It is a strange thing to be so fixed to the hand of the living wilderness. Perhaps it gives the god a tie to the civilised world. Balance within balance. Blue strands of light emerge from the machine to weave together in the air, taking the form of a torch. He taps a few more buttons. “Just need to find some flint—usually these braziers are lit, but—”</p><p> </p><p>“Let me,” his country says quietly, and pulls out a sputtering candle. </p><p> </p><p>“It’s easy once you get the hang of it,” Wild says with a sideways glance at Time. “I mean, we found you in the Lost Woods, so you probably know, but I don’t think your woods had this trick, and mine probably don’t have your way. It gets misty real quick if you step off the path, only the path is—invisible. So—”</p><p> </p><p>“Breathe,” Time says, oddly amused. Wild seems almost like a teenager trying to impress someone. The anachronism makes him wonder. </p><p> </p><p>“What do we have to do?”</p><p><br />“Usually just follow the torches,” Wild says, frustrated. “But the last few times I’ve been here, they keep getting extinguished. And these braziers? They’ve always been lit, even the first time I came. Even when I was twelve. People used to say it was to lure wanderers in. But now that Ganon’s gone, I think I’m—well. Not supposed to be—but.”</p><p> </p><p>“So—”</p><p> </p><p>“The falling sparks from the fire usually show the way,” he continues, holding the torch high and moving in a long, slow circle. The forest laughs. It’s a dark laughter. The sound of fog curling in the shadows of the trees. The sound of rotting meat covered over with fresh-fallen leaves. The sound of the moon on a winter night. Faces loom above them, crooked hands, crooked mouths. “It’s not—”</p><p> </p><p>He turns again, but the sparks fall in every direction, no direction. The coaxing does nothing. The woods remain impenetrable.</p><p> </p><p>Time sighs. </p><p> </p><p>“It’s not working,” Legend says. He looks at Time. Beckoning, waiting.</p><p> </p><p>“These Woods are different,” Time admits. “Not the trees I am used to. But the core of them does not change. I know my way.”</p><p> </p><p>It's blind hope. They seem to buy it.</p><p> </p><p>He steps off the not-path. It is trickery, nothing more. The dewy grass is no safer than the nettles. Both are pretending to be something they are not. He is practised in the art of keeping himself when the forest tries to lure him.</p><p> </p><p>There are eyes on his spine.</p><p> </p><p>As he walks, a soft whistle falls from his lips, but no kids appear at his waist and from behind. The chattering and gurgling and pinching he is hoping for never comes. There are no Skull Kids in this Lost Woods, then. No guardians. Where did they go? All the kids are older than ancient. They would not have given up so easily.</p><p> </p><p>The Lost Woods are closed to them.</p><p><br />“Time?” someone asks. “Why have we stopped?”</p><p> </p><p>“Are you following me?” he asks, bizarrely touched. The gods shrug almost audibly. </p><p> </p><p>“We didn’t have a better plan,” the god of legends says, so vulnerable in his words. So mortal. Magic is a troublemaker; it’s a storyteller’s job to exaggerate, to lie nicely. “You seem like you know what you’re doing.”</p><p> </p><p>Time almost chuckles. If only they knew. If they had been trying to find a token mortal who understood mortal life, he was a terrible stroke of luck for them. Instead he whistles again, sharper, more insistent, a demand rather than a greeting, and the wood responds. Fog leaps up around their feet and washes them into a deep white storm. And there are lights, in the fog, glowing lights, almost-fairies but not quite. A mimicry. A lure. The wind curls around his wrist as if to steal his hand away. It’s made of laughter, he realises. Tinkling, gurgling laughter. Familiar, still, all these years later.</p><p> </p><p><em> We know you, </em>says the fog and the wind. </p><p> </p><p>He does not speak the languages of weather, but he listens. He finds he knows them back.</p><p> </p><p><em> We know you, we know you… </em> the kids whisper. How bored they must have become, to shed their puppet bodies. How lonely. <em> We know you… you returned a long time ago. Now you return again…  </em></p><p> </p><p>“What’s happening?” cry the gods from the depths of the fog. “Where are we?”</p><p> </p><p>“I want to see!” shouts the wind god. There’s a rustling, then a thudding sound and some laughter. “My baton isn’t working!”</p><p> </p><p>“Wind, did you just stomp your foot like a little kid?”</p><p> </p><p>“Shut the <em> fuck </em> up,” the wind complains. “I don’t see you helping get us un-lost, <em> Legend.” </em></p><p> </p><p>“Hush,” says Time. “Nobody is lost.”</p><p> </p><p>“We can’t see,” the sky points out.</p><p> </p><p>“You’d know if you were lost,” Time assures them. “Now.” A silence settles back amongst them. </p><p> </p><p>The kids’ voices float through the air as if riding on motes of dust. Specks of pollen. Sliding along on the back of the heavy fog. Trapped in the fireflies and the glowbugs, false fairy-lights in the fog. Everywhere and nowhere. <em> We see you, we know you… </em></p><p> </p><p>“Now,” Time says again firmly. “No tricks. You know who I want to talk to.”</p><p> </p><p><em> We know you and you know us… </em> sigh the guardians of the Lost Woods. <em> You know there are no outsiders allowed in the heart of the forest.  </em></p><p> </p><p>Time swallows. </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Not even you, boything… </em>
</p><p> </p><p>The mist thickens impossibly. He is drowning in an emptiness, a colourless void. The air is wet and cold. He takes a step forward and almost stumbles. The gods are shouting.</p><p> </p><p>“Time?” they cry. “Time? Wild? What’s happening?”</p><p> </p><p>A hand creeps into his, small and light, and he squeezes it back before remembering—the kids are gone forever. Gone into fog. Whose hand, then is he holding?</p><p> </p><p>“Time,” says the tiny god of winds, tucked up against his side. “I found him!” He bellows into the white abyss. And then suddenly there’s a line of them, all holding hands, an unbroken string of myths made flesh. He cannot see them but he feels it, he hears it; they are in his bones.</p><p> </p><p>“Hold the line!” one of them roars.</p><p><br />“It’s no use,” Wild says, “we’re not allowed in! The woods are kicking us out! This is what they do—”</p><p> </p><p>“There’s more than one face to every circle,” Time tells the mist. “More than one side to every tree. I will not breach the heart of the woods. You have my word.”</p><p> </p><p><em> The word of a hylian, </em>the kids laugh.</p><p> </p><p>“Who are you talking to?” asks Wind from his side.</p><p> </p><p>“No,” Time says. “Not as a hylian. The children do not lie.” </p><p> </p><p><em> You are not one of the children, </em> the kids say. <em> You never were… </em></p><p> </p><p>“Maybe not,” he says, reluctant to say <em> kokiri </em>aloud, to speak into being the last word of a first language he has forgotten. “But I am what they made me.”</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Tricky, boything…  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>He allows himself the laugh. “Maybe so. But does my word mean nothing?”</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> We all mean nothing. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Enough riddles,” he does not say, because the kids have always loved riddles. “Please,” another word discarded. People have mercy. Forests don’t. “Ask my father,” is what he settles for, though there’s a lump in his throat. The gods are curling around in their ring of handholding to listen to him. </p><p> </p><p><em> The fathertree is soft at the root, </em>says the mist. </p><p> </p><p>“So take me to him,” Time barters. And like an ocean parting, the forest does. </p><p> </p><p>The mist clears for them; the trees lift their creeping boughs and close their toothy maws and shift aside like illusions collapsing. A path appears like an arrow shot from a bow. Time grasps the young hand of the wind god, another illusion, and tugs them all into the woods. The kid laughs as they hurry, delighted, and for a moment the memory of his older brother strikes him through the heart. The sailor used to laugh in the exact same way. Like he was half in awe of being alive. </p><p> </p><p>No longer.</p><p> </p><p>“Who is it?” someone calls, as they wind along the path in single file, hands overlapping. “Who are we going to see?”</p><p> </p><p>“I think I can guess,” laughs the wind. His hand is warm. It’s too much. “A wise old guardian. Heart of the forest.”</p><p> </p><p>Time makes a sound. “He is not the heart,” he says. “Or else we would not be permitted entry.”</p><p> </p><p>“Explain,” Legend says, short.</p><p> </p><p>“He grows around the heart,” Time says, because it is folly to deny a god, and folly to tell one they’re wrong. It’s only a lie in the same way it would be to say that Wind is a child. His father is not called <em>Great </em>without reason, and although the forest has never changed—had never changed—the trees are not without mischief. They might be allowed an audience with one side of his father, but that would not mean they would find the heart. Secret places, hidden places, other sides would remain out of reach. </p><p> </p><p>“The… the Great Deku Tree,” says Warriors, as if remembering something.</p><p> </p><p>“Him?” Wild asks, and Time wonders at his surprise. If anybody would know, if any creature would be worthy, it must surely be the living wilderness. Then it is explained: “your father?</p><p> </p><p>There is a murmuring among the gods.</p><p> </p><p>Warriors hastens closer to Time and Wind. “I used to know a boy,” he starts—then they are spilling through a log-tunnel into a clearing thronged with ferns and thick, luscious flowers. Fine as silk, delicate as lace. The fog has disappeared as if they dreamed it. Sunlight pools in the grass, shines through leaves, turns the world gold. The earth is black and wet and rich. The air smells of rain.</p><p> </p><p>The gods all move to let go of each other. Time almost cautions them otherwise—but they must be far more aware than him of the dangers of the Lost Woods, wouldn’t they? Even here, in this in-between, temptation glows on every leaf. To be lost so deep would be the end of them. Even them.</p><p> </p><p>He watches them breath in and out like tides rising and falling. He hasn’t been this close to his first home since before—since before. They are so much larger than the kokiri he remembers. Like giants, stretching out his memories; almost grotesque in their size, their age. They shouldn’t be here. <em> He </em>shouldn’t be here. He looks the worst of them all. </p><p> </p><p>“Korok Forest,” Wild says, annoyed. “I’ve <em> been </em>here. This isn’t—?”</p><p> </p><p>“Didn’t you say this place <em> was </em>the heart of the Lost Woods?” someone asks.</p><p> </p><p>“I thought it was,” Wild bites back. “You’re telling me, all this time, I wasn’t even—?”</p><p> </p><p>“No,” says Time.</p><p> </p><p>“They told me it was a secret place,” Wild says. “A special place.”</p><p> </p><p>“And it is,” he soothes. What would it look like, the frustration of the wilderness unleashed? Here, so close to this home of homes? Nothing good. Nothing peaceful. “But there is a more secret place, deeper still, where not even gods may visit.”</p><p> </p><p>“Have you been there?” Legend asks keenly.</p><p> </p><p>Time smiles.</p><p> </p><p>“So this is the Great Deku Tree’s—outer side?” Wild struggles. “What are you <em> saying? </em>You can walk all the way around him. There’s nothing hidden here.”</p><p> </p><p>Twilight nudges Legend, mumbling.</p><p> </p><p>Time doesn’t know <em> how </em>it works, only that it does. Shouldn’t the gods be more in touch with a world that slips around? The Lost Woods spin illusions like spidersilk. Here, deep under the shadow of the trees, they spiral. It’s likely that this outer sanctuary is a sliver of his father’s bark, warped into this huge clearing, patched with sun-dappled flowers. He doesn’t know. He doesn’t know.</p><p> </p><p>He knows this, though.</p><p> </p><p>His father has grown. </p><p> </p><p>As Four starts to bicker with Twilight distantly, Time steps forward along the path. Stones are laid out in welcome for them, ringed with puddles as if it has just finished raining. It doesn’t rain here. It never has. There is a triangular stone dias at the end; a notched stone at the centre. A sword.</p><p> </p><p>“I put it back,” Wild says awkwardly. “After.”</p><p> </p><p>After? After what? Is there a hero in this world somewhere, like him? There is an impossible gap in the canopy. Sunlight strikes her. She is glowing. </p><p> </p><p>He looks away.</p><p> </p><p>Away, and past her, and to tree bark. Gnarled and ragged, despite this weatherless place, so old it has become soft as paper, stretching up and up and—it is a root, just a root, not the trunk he was expecting. He presses forward, tugging the wind-child with him, fingers tangled, and the rest of the gods follow, or watch, silent—do gods pray? Do gods dream?</p><p> </p><p>Where the root meets the tree there is a round slice of exposed wood, a cut-away place to stand, and he does. </p><p> </p><p>“Time,” says the wind behind him, and the air gusts a little around them both. Is it rude, to bring gods into his father’s domain? Does he have to introduce them?</p><p> </p><p>It has been so long.</p><p> </p><p>“I never thought I would see you again,” Time starts, truthfully—</p><p>
  <br />
  <br />
</p><p> </p><hr /><p> </p><p>
  <br />
  <br />
</p><p>“Hello, father.” </p><p> </p><p>Eyelashes pressed into his cheeks, forehead smooth, the god touches the tree like a homecoming. From all around the clearing, the creatures Wild described as koroks emerge as if they were called. Like flowers to the sun they turn to him. Their little propellers spin silently. Hyrule gathers the armful of blue star-shaped flowers Wild gives him, watchful. Wary.</p><p> </p><p>“My son,” comes the reply. So it is true. Time’s father is a <em> tree. </em>How does it work? How is a god born of a plant? Did he crawl out of the bushes as a baby, like Wild climbing sopping wet from the Shrine? No. That was a rebirth, from how he tells it. Like Hyrule himself, then, who only remembers the road. Like Time shed his branches one day and stepped out of the soil. </p><p> </p><p>“I never thought I’d see you again,” the god says again. He leans closer. Hyrule sees Wind squeeze his hand a little, for comfort. Warriors’ eyebrows move a little.</p><p> </p><p>The tree laughs. “You could have tried,” it says. </p><p> </p><p>Time shakes his head. “No—I—the kokiri can’t leave the lost woods. We’re—we’re not allowed. I wasn’t supposed to.” He takes a breath, and then another, and then continues, quieter. “I left. I wasn’t swallowed by the lost woods. I—”</p><p> </p><p>“Kokiri,” Wild hisses at Hyrule. “That’s different. I know <em> korok, </em>but—”</p><p> </p><p>“Kokiri,” Hyrule echoes. </p><p> </p><p>“The ultimate test of belonging,” Time admits. “I did not want to be proven wrong.”</p><p> </p><p>“You have not been stolen yet,” the tree says evenly. “Does that not answer your question?”</p><p> </p><p>“I haven’t gone deep enough,” Time responds. He shakes his head. “I haven’t gone deep enough.”</p><p> </p><p>The tree rumbles. Hyrule tenses a little. It’s—he can’t help it. This Great Deku Tree is <em> huge. </em>Beyond the green canopy, there is another higher canopy, a pink one, not made from leaves but great trailing blossoms. Honey-sweet, big enough to contain the entire clearing underneath it. The tree is what Hyrule has been smelling the entire time, he realises. Notes of it in the wind and the fog. Thick enough now at the epicentre that he feels like he’s floating.</p><p> </p><p>Wild darts away. Hyrule grips his flowers and follows, under the mammoth tree-roots, through the grass. There’s a path, a sort of tunnel, more flowers, a few decorated wood-pots. They look a little like huge, hollowed-out nuts, but that would be ridiculous. Tree-nuts don’t grow big enough for Hyrule to put his boots in. </p><p> </p><p>Trees don’t grow big enough to have <em> furniture </em> inside them <em> . </em></p><p> </p><p>“Do you know what he was talking about?” Hyrule prompts, nudging Wild. </p><p> </p><p>Wild scowls. “What does it mean?” he asks the korok on the other side of the cookpot, which is  bubbling away like it was waiting for them. Hyrule eyes the leaf-bed in an alcove curiously. Is that for Wild? Time? All of them? Or is this place like the visitor’s suite of the woods? Time told them all it wasn’t the heart—so what was it?</p><p> </p><p>Wild flicks his tongue, then makes an attempt at curling it into the shape of the word Time had dropped like well-worn velvet. “<em> Kokiri?” </em></p><p> </p><p>The korok burbles. </p><p> </p><p>“Kokiri?” Wild tries again. Hyrule passes him a flower and gives it his own take.</p><p> </p><p>“<em> Kokiri,” </em>he says, with a little bit of fairy in the word. </p><p> </p><p>“Me,” says the korok. </p><p> </p><p>“Not korok, <em> kokiri.” </em></p><p> </p><p>“Me!” says the korok again. Then it laughs. “Ya-ha-ha-ha!”</p><p> </p><p>“If you’re kokiri,” Hyrule says, giving Wild another flower. “Where’s your leaf-clothes? And your hat? And your fairy?”</p><p> </p><p>“You know what a kokiri is,” Wild says bluntly. </p><p> </p><p>“You’re pronouncing it wrong,” Hyrule tells him. “And maybe. I think so. Not by that name, but… little tree-children are in all the legends. They’re a kind of fairy, probably. One died a long time ago, or something that people <em> thought </em>was a fairy, at least. Maybe they made it up.”</p><p> </p><p>The korok squeaks. “We don’t do that,” it says. “Playtime is never over. Fathertree gives us playtime <em> forever. </em> We even get to play in all of Hyrule, now. Now the kids flew away, they can’t stop us anymore! Not strong enough! <em> ” </em></p><p> </p><p>“You really are a child, ” Wild says curiously. “How old are you?”</p><p> </p><p>“Ya-ha-ha-ha!” it laughs again, “ya-ha-ha-ha!”</p><p> </p><p>“The kids flew away?” </p><p> </p><p>“You saw them! They said hello.”</p><p> </p><p>“The,” Wild flexes his wrist. Clutches the pretty blue-white-gold petals in his hand. “The lights in the fog?”</p><p> </p><p>“Come on,” Hyrule says, antsy. “Let’s go.”</p><p> </p><p>“Well, where are your fairies?” Wild spits out, as Hyrule flees from the bowels of Time’s father. Bell-shaped hanging plants light their way. “If you used to—” Hyrule hears a rush of movement, and then Wild is at his side. “Where <em> are </em>the the fairies?” he hisses. “There’s usually some.”</p><p> </p><p>“There you are,” Sky says. </p><p> </p><p>“We’ve got some flowers for you,” Hyrule decides, and shoves Wild and his armful of blossoms off-balance into Sky’s chest. Then he dashes madly away across the grass, snickering to himself. There’s a lightness in the air. A sweetness. He could do a cartwheel right now. With a sudden rush of excitement, he attempts it, and trips over his limbs with spectacular uncoordination. He tumbles over and over, head spinning, laughing harder than he can ever remember laughing, and comes to a rolling halt next to Twilight.</p><p> </p><p>“You having fun there, you little jester?” </p><p> </p><p>“There’s so much <em> magic </em>,” he responds, still laughing, and rolls over in the grass to press his forehead into Twilight’s knee.</p><p> </p><p>“I know,” Twilight says. He’s got his sleeves rolled up and boots off in the grass. He squints down at Hyrule through the sun. “Even I can feel it, and if you’d gave me a magic wand, I’d put someone’s eye out.”</p><p> </p><p>“So’d I,” Hyrule declares. “It’s a pointy stick, what else would you do with it?”</p><p> </p><p>“Magic,” Twilight says.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh…” says Hyrule, as insincerely as he can manage. “Well, that makes sense! Why didn’t <em> I </em>think of that!”</p><p> </p><p>“You little noodle,” replies Twilight, equally fond and exasperated, and lunges over to tickle him. Hyrule has already wiggled out of reach. He can feel dirt on his cheek and he’s going to be <em> so </em> itchy later from rolling around in the grass. He doesn’t care. He’s been feasting on the magic their new resident god trails around for hours now but this isn’t just a feast anymore, it’s a <em> banquet. </em>He shrieks as Twilight almost manages to grab him, legs kicking. Twilight’s a wrestler. If he manages to get hold of Hyrule, he’s doomed.</p><p> </p><p>He’s doing pretty well for himself until he rolls into a tree root, anyway. Twilight gets his evil fingers into the ticklish crease of Hyrule’s hip, and his leather underarmour doesn’t get down past his sternum, so it’s useless. “Ruthless monster!” he accuses. </p><p> </p><p>“I’ll show you a ruthless monster,” Twilight agrees. Hyrule kicks him in the shoulder and scrambles to make his escape, but the root gets in the way. Twilight hip-checks him and rocks back with his ankle and somehow manages to roll them both away from the root and into the sun next to the weird sword pedestal, where he proceeds to sit on Hyrule’s legs and tickle him as ruthlessly as threatened. Hyrule thrashes around and tries to buck him off uselessly. He’s laughing so hard his stomach hurts<em> .  </em></p><p> </p><p>“I’m gonna—I’m—I’m gonna <em> bite you,” </em>he gasps out, still writhing.</p><p> </p><p>“You wouldn’t,” Twilight starts to say with far too much confidence, before Hyrule latches on to his forearm. He yelps like a startled dog and flings Hyrule back across the grass. </p><p> </p><p> “It’s my secret weapon,” Hyrule gasps, laughter fading, and bares his teeth.</p><p> </p><p>Twilight bares his teeth right back. They’re much pointier. </p><p> </p><p>“What do you think of him?” </p><p> </p><p>“The Great Deku Tree?” Twilight asks, thrown by the change in conversation.</p><p> </p><p>“Time, of course.”</p><p> </p><p>Twilight’s eyes flick to the side, and up, to where Wind is dangling his little boots off the side of the root and kicking them around idly. The god himself—both of them, because the Great Deku Tree must be divine or at least immortal, to be this powerful, to have lasted this long—are talking in low voices. Twilight’s jaw tightens, and he starts putting his socks back on. “Kid’s taken a shine to him.”</p><p> </p><p>“What about you?” Hyrule presses.</p><p> </p><p>Twilight flicks his sock out to get the grass off it and doesn’t answer. Hyrule wrinkles his nose.</p><p> </p><p>“If Ordona weren't already keeping an eye on me, I'd pray to him,” he eventually says, gruff. “Between her and the Light Spirits, I'd say my ass is covered.” </p><p> </p><p>“He seems like a good man,” Hyrule returns. He blinks. “Are gods also men? A good deity? Kind, at least. Kinder than I might've thought. I'm sure a lot of people do pray to him.”</p><p> </p><p>“Maybe you should start,” Twilight says, uncharacteristically distant. “Hasn't there ever been nothing you wanted to change?”</p><p> </p><p>“Surely even a god can't fix the past?”</p><p> </p><p>Twilight shrugs. “Time, he said. If not past, then future. O forefather, O counter of heartbeats, O he who keeps the rhythm of stars, grant me peace and long life; let the world not require my sword.”</p><p> </p><p>Hyrule hums. There’s always been a steadiness to the way Twilight talks. A smoothness, a softness. But this is more. The prayer fits in his mouth like it was always meant to be there. Constant and unwavering as the turning of the earth. Constant and unwavering as <em> Time. </em>“Where’d that come from?”</p><p> </p><p>Twilight grunts a little. Shrugs again. He finishes tugging on one boot and starts with the other. </p><p> </p><p>Far above their heads, the sunlight shimmers. Hyrule shades his eyes with a hand and looks up to see a familiar mop of yellow hair. What exactly Wild thinks he’s doing climbing up the Great Deku Tree’s eyebrows, Hyrule isn’t entirely sure, but he’s tempted to join in.</p><p> </p><p>“What does he look like to you?” Twilight says abruptly.</p><p> </p><p>“What?”</p><p> </p><p>“Time.”</p><p> </p><p>“Uh.” How to explain what it feels like? The magic that surrounds the god? The wood-fairy scent? Hyrule can taste the golden goddesses in the air Time leaves behind—and hadn’t that been a trip, to see a god breathing. It reminds him of Legend and his shrouds of magic jewelry, his countless blessings, like every magical creature in the world has staked a personal claim on his safety. “Two legs, two arms, one eye. Gold-plated.”</p><p> </p><p>“He looks like he’s wearing the armour my ancestor died in,” Twilight says, like he’s trying to convince himself it isn’t a big deal. “Just wondering if it were the same for everybody.”</p><p> </p><p>The sound of Wild’s paraglider deploying breaks into the background rustling of leaves. Hyrule cranes his neck up. </p><p> </p><p>“So,” Wild says breathlessly, landing on another root. “I went up to talk to Walton, and the fairies are not happy.”</p><p> </p><p>“What is any of that supposed to mean?” </p><p> </p><p>“Walton’s not—there’s this little pond at the top of Great Deku Tree, in a hollow. Fairies gather there. Every time I’ve been here, there’s been fairies. And now, only a handful, and they are <em> jittery </em>.” He plants both hands on his hips.</p><p> </p><p>“Hm,” says the tree with a rumble, and Hyrule realises again with a jolt how <em> huge </em>he is.</p><p> </p><p>Time takes his palms off the bark and asks, “fairies?”</p><p> </p><p>“They’ve been less frequent visitors, of late,” the tree admits. “They seem to be lying low.”</p><p> </p><p>“Come and see,” Wild challenges.</p><p> </p><p>“Let’s see if I can coax them out,” Time replies instead. Does he just not want to climb his father? Is that too undignified? Should Wild have probably not said that? Is Time the type of god to get offended? “I’ve got something that should help.” Wind hands him his pack and he sticks an arm inside it briefly: emerges with a white oval, painted with huge spiky pink eye-shapes, strung with beads, festooned with great lengths of flowing yarn and ivy. They all blink at it sceptically. Then he fits it over his head and—</p><p> </p><p>“Oh,” Hyrule gasps. “Hello.”</p><p> </p><p>He staggers forward, clutching at a bemused Twilight. It’s like Time is getting bigger, somehow, or maybe the rest of the world is getting smaller. He’s so <em> glittery. </em> And <em> bright. </em>And—</p><p> </p><p>“Whoa, there,” Twilight says, as Hyrule trips over his own feet, but Hyrule doesn’t even have the breath to make fun of him for being a cowboy. He giggles, and lurches forward, closer to Time, closer to the <em> god— </em></p><p> </p><p>Everything is a swirl of sound and colour, but there are fairies, he sees fairies twinkling, zipping in a loop around Time’s head. One passes over him and Twilight on its way to the god and he giggles again; falls to his knees on the grass. Its wings clip the side of his ear as it goes and it’s <em> warm, </em> and it’s <em> bright, </em>and he shivers with the overwhelming splendour of it all.</p><p> </p><p>“Ssh,” Twilight says, hands on his shoulders, forearms, steadying, supporting. “Hush now.”</p><p> </p><p>He sees through a kaleidoscope more fairies, ever more fairies. Several flutter first to Warriors and brush against his hair and scarf before making their way over to Time. The vision swirls, too distinct, too detailed amidst his jumbled mind. Too vibrant, too high contrast. Everything has been turned up too bright. Too bright. Warriors is smiling; the smile swallows universes. Hyrule is drowning in it. It’s so much. It’s so much.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s so much,” he mumbles. Giggles again.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re coming over real funny,” Twilight tells him, concerned. </p><p> </p><p>How to explain to him that sound is fractured? That he sees ten, twenty, fifty copies of every blade of grass and leaf? That there are colours in his eyes that have never existed, and will never exist, and have perhaps always been there just in front of him? Is this what it’s like to be a god? Hyrule digs his fingers into the grass and it is met with a billion individual grains of earth, and ants, and worms, and life—he shudders through the feeling, rapturous, overcome.</p><p> </p><p>“Hm,” says the pink blob that is Time’s face. Only it’s not Time’s face. It’s a woman’s face. A Great Mother’s face. Why does Time have the face of a Great Mother? Where did he get it from?</p><p> </p><p>“S’strange,” Hyrule slurs.</p><p> </p><p>“Steady now,” says Twilight.</p><p> </p><p>“What’s he doing up there?” Sky hisses, coming over to join them, and Hyrule realises that they can’t see Time and his Great Mother face up on the root-platform, they can’t see the invisible colours, they can’t see the beads and the glittering and the brightness. It’s the wrong angle. It’s all the wrong angle. How is <em> he </em>seeing it, even? There’s a root in the way. His eyes are looking around corners. Reality is bent around him, around a straight line between him and the Great Mother. Like gravity.</p><p> </p><p>“There’s a root in the way,” he laughs to himself. “The pink is too powerful for the root. The pink is glowing…”</p><p> </p><p>“He’s gone delirious,” he hears Twilight telling Sky. </p><p> </p><p>“M’not <em> delirious,” </em> Hyrule gasps. “I’m being <em> enlightened. </em>Solids are,” he makes an inarticulate gesture, “persuadable.”</p><p> </p><p>“Delirious,” Twilight says again soothingly.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re blind,” Hyrule says. “You’re all blind<em> . </em> And I can see <em> , </em> I can <em> see </em> . <em> ” </em></p><p> </p><p>The moment the words leave his mouth, the world fractures around him. Every sensation drops out of reach. His vision goes flat and smooth and dull and he’s suddenly filled with an intense conviction that he’s dying and then—</p><p> </p><p>“Holy <em> Time,” </em>says Hyrule. He blinks, cross-eyed. The Great Mother face has vanished. He can’t even see over the curve of the root anymore to Time’s pack, just the soles of Wind’s little boots still dangling off the edge, and the clusters of fairies still hanging around the Great Deku Tree. “What just happened to me?”</p><p> </p><p>“No clue,” Twilight tells him, greatly amused. Hyrule gets up out of the grass. “But it was mighty entertaining.” He clasps a hand to his chest and reclines dramatically across Sky. “<em> You’re all blind! I’m the only one who can see! </em> Hark at the little prophet! <em> ” </em></p><p> </p><p>“That’s not even what I said,” Hyrule grumbles. </p><p> </p><p>He stumbles away from them. Runs up to where the sloped root protrudes from the earth, digs his hands into the bark and half-walks, half-crawls up ungainly. At the top, Wind is humming like it might convince the fairies he <em> isn’t </em>trying to sneak up and bottle them. Time looks solemn.</p><p> </p><p>“What was that?” Hyrule demands. “Where’d you—” he shakes his head, trying to remember what he’d seen. “How’d you get a Great Mother’s face?” </p><p> </p><p>The fairy sitting on Time’s curled index finger takes flight. “I have melodies that could make you know peace,” the god says. “I have items that could drive a man mad.”</p><p> </p><p>Hyrule huffs. “The real Great Mothers don’t make me feel like that.”</p><p> </p><p>“Are the Great Mothers you know healthy?” asks the tree. “Are they prospering?”</p><p> </p><p>Hyrule scowls.</p><p> </p><p>“In any case, the borrowed power of a Great Mother is the least of your problems right now, young one,” says the tree in that all-encompassing rumble. “The fairies have been fleeing a beast.”</p><p> </p><p>“The shadow the council spoke of,” Time says. “He’s here.”</p><p> </p>
