    <p> </p><p>The path that leads him into the woods is paved in smooth stone, dark like the earth after rain. Link walks with the clink of golden armour and there is nobody around to hear it. Folk in these parts know better than to follow roads that stay pretty without being tended. Bandits swarm in the dusty by-lanes, but better to have coin stolen and barns raided than to chance the gaping maw of the trees.</p><p> </p><p>People have mercy. Forests don’t.</p><p> </p><p>He walks into the mist. The road winds around in circles, then peters out, slowly, like a river reaching the sea. His boots sink into grass that brushes his knees. He can feel eyes on his spine.</p><p> </p><p>He takes a deep breath and releases it.</p><p> </p><p>He was born here. But he does not belong here. He knows the feeling of the sun through the trees better than he knows his name, or his face, or the sword calluses on his palm, but the wood is perilous to him still.</p><p> </p><p>The easy way leads deeper, to the heart, the places he cannot find again and will lose himself trying. And he is here only for a shortcut. Time is different in the woods. Slower. Thicker. So he must take the harder way, through the nettles and the thorns. </p><p> </p><p>If all goes well, he will pass without disturbing anything that sleeps here, and will emerge from the thickets behind Castle Town at the other end of the country—how soon, he can’t tell. No more than a kokiri hour, as the children used to say, even though he can’t remember how long the kokiri hour was.</p><p> </p><p>“Boything,” something whispers to him. He sighs.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, kid?”</p><p> </p><p>The puppet looks at him, wide-eyed. “Boything,” it says again, like it’s testing the word out. It doesn’t know his name. He’s not young and innocent enough to give it. Better to be nameless.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes?” he answers, though it’s been decades since anybody called him a boy. He used to be one, he thinks. Briefly. In between being a child and a monster.</p><p> </p><p>The puppet’s finger twitches as he sets down the pack full of masks and lets his sword fall to rest beneath a tree. A dedicated finger of wind is winding carefully through the trees. He tips his head and lets it cool his skin.</p><p> </p><p>“There’s people in the woods,” the puppet tells him, with insects instead of pupils caught in the amber eyes of its wooden face. The one in the left eye looks like some sort of wasp, angry and black and long extinct. All the kids are older than ancient. Time moves differently in the woods.</p><p> </p><p>“People?” he repeats. Another puppet crawls out of the shrubbery, joints sliding in opposition to his own. “Can’t you chase them out of the woods?”</p><p> </p><p>“We think you should do it,” the second kid confides. “These ones are different.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re being interrupted at a game,” he translates.</p><p> </p><p>Neither kid will meet his eyes, which all but confirms it. A third puppet suddenly touches the small of his back and he catches himself from leaping a foot into the air. “Boything, you’re gold,” it says wonderingly.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s armour,” he replies patiently, and brushes the thing’s wooden hands off his belt, retrieving the tiny hunting knife that has been quietly taken from him. The puppet lets him take it, hands placid and easy to manoeuvre, like a child’s. “For protection.”</p><p> </p><p>“We can do protection,” the kids offer. “Without gold, even.”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s kind,” he tells them, politely, “but I like my armour.”</p><p> </p><p>Protection to a skull kid is wood and mist and eternity. He cannot lose himself now. She’s waiting for him at home, a lanturn burning in the window.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay,” he says. “I’ll lead them out.”</p><p> </p><p>“Out, in,” the first kid says idly. “Doesn’t matter. Make them go.”</p><p> </p><p>“Okay,” he says again. There’s nothing else he can say.</p><p> </p><p>If the kids could move their faces, he thinks they would smile. As it is, laughter bubbles from their wooden throats. The grins carved into their faces seem a little more sincere. “You’re welcome to join the game,” one of them burbles instead of thanks. The forest does not say thanks.</p><p> </p><p>“Once they’re gone?”</p><p> </p><p>“Once they’re gone!” the kids agree, and run in their jerky, shuddering way under the low-hanging branch of a shadowy tree, into fog so white he cannot see them go. He buckles his pack and picks up his sword. The forest must not be allowed to steal them.</p><p> </p><p>He will have to make a detour on his shortcut. No matter. Time moves differently in the woods. It slips and slides around—changes faces in the unblinking stare of an amber eye, in the wind that can’t decide which direction to blow from, the compass that spins never ending. He’ll still be early if he needs to.</p><p><br />
<br />
</p><p> </p><hr /><p> </p><p><br />
<br />
</p><p>The campsite is damp and shrouded in tricky tendrils of mist, but it’s the best one they’ve found for weeks. Wild sits on the ground with his knees tucked into his chest and turns the slate on and off again obsessively.</p><p> </p><p>“Still fried?” Legend asks. </p><p> </p><p>Wild hums. He bashes the screen with the flat of his palm. <em> Error, </em> the map tells him. <em> Signal not found </em>.</p><p> </p><p>“The portal killed it,” he says mournfully. He shakes it. Is that rattling? Is something loose? “The portal killed it stone dead.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’ve still got half your inventory,” Legend offers. “Even if it glitches every time you try to take something out.”</p><p> </p><p>“Stone dead,” Wild repeats. “Might as well <em> be </em> a stone.” He swivels suddenly. “How’d you know about my inventory?”</p><p> </p><p>Legend smirks. Wild throws a twig at him and retreats up a tree to sulk. He settles in a thick, broad fork. Leaves cradle him. He squirms onto his stomach until he can see through a gap in the canopy. Warriors is arguing with Four about the correct way to set up bedrolls.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, where’d Wild go?” Sky asks suddenly.</p><p> </p><p>“He died with the slate,” Legend responds. He tucks himself into Sky’s side like always—closer than any of the rest of them are allowed. Legend has a very distinct sense of personal space, but for some reason he’s never bothered to tell Sky about it. And Sky gives out hugs like clouds give rain and plants give flowers. “Turns out it was life support. I buried him over behind that gloomy-looking tree.”</p><p> </p><p>“They’re all gloomy-looking,” Sky responds, instead of questioning Wild’s death appropriately. Wild feels a little offended.</p><p> </p><p>“That one’s gloomier than most,” Legend says.</p><p> </p><p>Sky squints thoughtfully. “Can’t see it,” he decides. It’s outrageous. Does he not care that one of his reincarnations has reportedly kicked the bucket right there in the woods?</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not dead,” Wild says from the tree. He watches Sky hide a smile and pouts. So he was just pretending.</p><p> </p><p>“Sometimes I can still hear his voice,” Legend says airily. Sky hums.</p><p> </p><p>Wild growls and drops out of the tree onto his head. His pride has been bruised. He puts a knee in Legend’s stomach.</p><p> </p><p>Legend elbows him in the head and sweeps his ankles out from under him. Wild makes a furious, intelligible sound, and launches himself forward from his hands and knees. Like the bears in Tabantha when they get spooked. Like the foxes that flee from the undergrowth. He ducks under Legend’s fist and digs his fingernails into Legend’s arm—shouts at the pained grunt Legend gives him—rolls under a vicious kick that was heading straight for his shins and opens his mouth and pushes his face towards Legend’s other arm and—</p><p> </p><p>A hand hooks itself in the collar of his tunic and yanks him back. A whine slips out of him. He shakes it off with a full-body shudder. Sometimes he thinks he spent too long with the beasts after he woke. When he’s startled their languages fall out of him more easily than recalcitrant, relearnt hylian words. </p><p> </p><p>Legend’s panting, just an arms-length away, red-faced and defiant. Blood is dripping down his forearm from the scratches. The hand on the back of Wild’s shirt shakes him lightly, once, and lets him drop. Wild lets himself fall. He lands catlike on his feet, back slumped.</p><p> </p><p>“That’s enough fighting,” Sky says quietly.</p><p> </p><p>Wild looks away, ashamed. </p><p> </p><p>“Whatever,” Legend sneers. There’s a familiar spark of adrenaline leaping in his eye. Wild isn’t very good at reading faces—he can’t tell if Legend is angry, or just proud, or in denial that he was losing. It would be easier if he was a beast. If he used his body to talk instead of his duplicitous mouth. “It wasn’t me who started it.”</p><p> </p><p>“Sorry, did I ask?” Sky says.</p><p> </p><p>“Didn’t mean it,” Wild sulks. “Just a fight.” </p><p> </p><p>He never used to have this problem before he found out there were still people alive in the world who weren’t either a ghost king or a half-dead princess waiting for him in a castle. Before he realised that to talk to people in Kakariko and Hateno and Tarry Town he had to use <em> words </em>and not just teeth. </p><p> </p><p>Beasts understand teeth very well. It turned out that people do not.</p><p> </p><p>Sky levels him with a carefully polite expression that wouldn’t look out of place on Impa. “You can’t attack your allies whenever you feel like it,” he says patiently.</p><p> </p><p>Legend bares his teeth at Wild. Wild snarls back. He shifts his weight forward into the balls of his feet, ready to pounce. Then he remembers Sky.</p><p> </p><p>“No,” Sky tells them both. “No,” and that’s the end of it. He hustles Wild off to the other end of the clearing and sets him down in front of the pot. Then he takes Legend over to Warriors, who carries bandages in his belt pouch for this sort of thing.</p><p> </p><p>“Stop fussing,” Legend grunts.</p><p> </p><p>“He tried to <em> bite </em>you,” Sky says in a murmur that wasn’t as low as it was likely supposed to be.</p><p> </p><p>“I think he was just playing. Probably.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m sorry,” says Warriors, “he <em> what?” </em></p><p> </p><p>“More beast than man, that one,” Sky says wisely. “Goddess love him, but he doesn’t take teasing very well at all.”</p><p> </p><p>“Maybe you should stop teasing him, then,” Four says.</p><p> </p><p>“I think he can handle it,” Legend disagrees, “it’s just that nobody’s taught him how to tease back.”</p><p> </p><p>Twilight appears from behind Wild’s shoulder and sticks his head in the empty pot curiously. “What’s up, cub?” </p><p> </p><p>“Nothing,” Wild grumbles. He presses the button on his slate to take out a carrot. It beeps aggressively at him. The screen freezes. He whacks it on the edge of the pot.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey—hey,” Twilight says, catching his hand and giving his fingers a light squeeze. “Don’t do that. It’ll break.”</p><p> </p><p>“Already broken.”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s no reason to break it more,” he suggests logically.</p><p> </p><p>“I hate you,” Wild says.</p><p> </p><p>Twilight laughs at him. “No, you don’t. You’re just frustrated. What’s up?”</p><p> </p><p>Wild makes a vague sound of discontent. “Dunno,” he says, and shivers. He tries the button again. A wrinkled, wormy carrot drops into his palm.</p><p> </p><p>Twilight waits.</p><p> </p><p>“Tried to bite Legend,” Wild says eventually. </p><p> </p><p>“Oh, cub,” Twilight snorts. He looks almost amused. “That’s the fifth time this week.”</p><p> </p><p>“He’s biteable,” Wild agrees. He shrugs. “I don’t know. I just keep—and they don’t get it. I’m not trying to be mean.”</p><p> </p><p>Twilight hums. He looks thoughtful. “You know what I think? I think it’s the woods.”</p><p> </p><p>“What?”</p><p> </p><p>“These woods are getting everyone on edge.”</p><p> </p><p>Wild scoffs. He coaxes another carrot from the slate.</p><p> </p><p>“We can’t find an end to them,” Twilight outlines, “we’ve been walking for—what, twenty-three days now? With no change in scenery? We move slower as a group than any of us do individually. I know you’re used to running, cub. It must be driving you crazy.”</p><p> </p><p>Wild dumps the carrots back in the slate. Useless. “Did you find any meat?” he says flatly.</p><p> </p><p>“Listen,” Twilight says. “You’ve heard it.”</p><p> </p><p>“The silence,” he acknowledges, grudging.</p><p> </p><p>“No birds,” Twilight says, “no insects, no game. Nothing to hunt.”</p><p> </p><p>“No meat,” Wild concludes sourly. He pokes at the slate. He’s got milk in there somewhere. The corner of the screen is cracked. He doesn’t think the crack was there a minute ago. Maybe Twilight was right and he shouldn’t have whacked it on the pot. “So what are we gonna eat for dinner, then?”</p><p> </p><p>“Rations,” Twilight says simply. “Whatever’s left. And we pray we get outta these woods soon.”</p><p> </p><p>Wild scoffs again. “I’ve climbed,” he offers. “The fog extends above the canopy. Can’t see nothing.”</p><p> </p><p>Twilight chews his lip. “That’s not normal.”</p><p> </p><p>“Well, when’s anything normal for us?”</p><p> </p><p>“You know,” he muses, “I’m starting to wonder whether we’re in some other era’s version of the Lost—”</p><p> </p><p>Across the clearing, fire lights up in the mist like a beacon. Wind shrieks. </p><p> </p><p>“Give it <em> back!” </em>Legend is screaming.</p><p> </p><p>“You’ll set us all on fire!” Warriors shouts back. “I’m confiscating it!”</p><p> </p><p>“We need water!” Four cries. </p><p> </p><p>Twilight sucks in a breath. “I’d better go check that out,” he says with an apologetic glance at Wild. He vanishes into the mist, which is thickening by the second. </p><p> </p><p>Like icy water, a chill runs down Wild’s spine. He spins. Nobody’s watching him. Why does it feel like somebody is breathing down his neck? Peering at him from the trees? The fire burns hot and gold. Wind shrieks again. </p><p> </p><p>“Why are trees so <em> flammable?” </em>someone shouts.</p><p> </p><p>“Cause they’re made of fucking wood<em>, </em>dipshit!” Legend roars back.</p><p> </p><p>“Water!” says Four again. “Someone get water!”</p><p> </p><p>Something thumps. “Get away from it, Hyrule!” Warriors orders. “You’ll get—”</p><p> </p><p>There’s a fizzing, and Wild tastes magic in the air. Someone yelps. “That didn’t work!” Sky says, a touch panicked. “What do we do now?”</p><p> </p><p>Wild fiddles with his slate. If he could get the cryonis rune to work, maybe—or there’s a blizzard rod somewhere in his—</p><p> </p><p>The screen goes dark. He smacks it against the pot again. Nothing happens. No—no, no, no—His memories are stored in that stupid rock. The last proof he has of Zelda. What is he going to do if—? He sort of wants to cry. </p><p> </p><p>“Legend, you’ve got those medallions, right? What do they do?”</p><p> </p><p>Legend makes a sound that’s halfway between a scream and a bellow. “Explosions! Earthquakes! Lightning!”</p><p> </p><p>“Nothing <em> useful?” </em></p><p> </p><p>“They’re plenty useful! Just not right now!”</p><p> </p><p>“Anyone?” Four asks. “I’ve already poured all our drinking water on it, there’s no more—”</p><p> </p><p>The fire catches a tree and licks at the trunk—the leaves rise up in flames. A crackle, a sharp crack—a branch, coated in tongues of flame, falls out of the sky—</p><p> </p><p>“We’re going to die!” Wind shrieks. Warriors shoves his scarf up over his nose and holds out the dragging end for Wind to do the same. Wild stares at it. The fire sucks in another breath of air and spits back flaming sparks and embers that fly around the clearing, burning in the fog—</p><p> </p><p>A chime sounds.</p><p> </p><p>Wild sneaks a look at the cracked slate in his hands, but the screen is dim and silent. And this can’t be his Slate anyway, his Slate has never made a noise like this—so even and melodic as it rises and falls steadily—</p><p> </p><p>A figure appears amid the ash, surrounded by flame curling across the ground, holding something blue to its mouth. The music sharpens. A trill, and then a high, smooth run.</p><p> </p><p>Wild stares. His pulse thrums in time with the song.</p><p> </p><p>There is a glorious, breathtaking moment of silence, when even the fire seems to pause in its tracks. Twilight’s jaw has dropped. Sky’s face is slack. Legend’s eyes are round as opals.</p><p> </p><p>Then the fog opens, and rain starts to fall.</p><p> </p><p>Wild fell off a cliff once. Well, more than once, but the first time—he’d slipped on a rock still wet from the morning drizzle and slithered right off a ledge into the lake. It’d been a short fall, considering, but it had surprised him. As the air swept past him he’d struggled to take a breath, disorientated, and then the water had met him in a cold, heavy rush. He’d sunk three lengths before he’d realised what was happening. Struggled for the surface with the feeling that the world had just skipped over something. Something in between the climbing and the swimming. It had happened too quickly.</p><p> </p><p>The rain feels like that. Like a bucket dumped over his head. Like falling.</p><p> </p><p>He drops the slate from nerveless fingers and gasps into the shock of it. </p><p> </p><p>“Gods,” he hears someone whisper. </p><p> </p><p>He can still hear the music, floating in the rain, somehow. Like it <em> is </em>the rain. </p><p> </p><p>Water pours down his forehead. He feels a steady stream slide down his nose and scrubs his eyes. His tunic is soaking. The ground is suddenly muddy. Steam is billowing out from the trees. The fire is hissing as it dies. It’s hard to breathe.</p><p> </p><p>Just as Wild’s beginning to think he’s going to drown, the rain stops.</p><p> </p><p>The Chain all heave into the silence, gulping desperate mouthfuls of air. The water streaming from their clothes and hands and hair slow to a trickle, then a steady dripping. It sounds unnaturally loud. Nobody dares speak.</p><p><br />
The steam clears, slowly, outlining the silhouette of a man. Like a glimpse through a crack in the sky. A piece of the sacred realm. A magic so deep and old and musical none of them should have ever witnessed it. The man lowers his hands. An ocarina is tucked comfortably in his palm. It looks unremarkable.</p><p> </p><p>He is dry.</p><p> </p><p>Wild swaps wide-eyed stares with the rest of the Chain. </p><p> </p><p>“The Lost Woods want you to leave,” says the—could he be a mere man? He seems inconceivably old and young all at once. The trees are curled over him as if to offer him shelter. He is plated in gold and far too comfortable in the midst of an unknown group of armed men and impossibly, terrifyingly serene.</p><p> </p><p>“We’ve been trying,” Warriors says, voice smaller than he probably means it to be. He clears his throat. “We haven’t been able to find a way out.”</p><p> </p><p>The man—the distinctly <em> not </em>-man hums. “You’re interrupting the game.”</p><p> </p><p>“The… the game?”</p><p> </p><p>“The kids like to play,” says the not-man, sounding almost <em> normal </em>for a moment. Then he smiles and Wild’s hindbrain shrieks. This is something that dug its way out of the wet earth, he thinks. He bares his teeth.</p><p> </p><p>“If it helps,” Warriors plods on, miserably resigned to being the group’s spokesperson, “we’re here by accident, we don’t mean any harm. Hylia—or <em> someone, </em>at least—dropped us here via a magic portal—”</p><p> </p><p>“Hylia,” says the not-man. He exhales, slowly, in a way that seems deliberate. Like he doesn’t need to, but he is anyway. “I know her trickery well.”</p><p> </p><p>Legend elbows Wild, animosity forgotten. “Did he just admit to<em> knowing a goddess personally?” </em></p><p> </p><p>Wild doesn’t know how to put words to the frantic, curling things inside him. He tries for the soft whining of a surprised fox and hopes that Legend understands.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah,” says the veteran. “Is<em> — </em>is he a…?”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m known as Warriors,” Warriors says, and sticks his hand out gingerly. “This is Wind, Twilight, Wild, Sky, Legend, Four, and Hyrule—I know, like the country. Are you a Link? A… a hero?”</p><p> </p><p>The not-man looks at the proffered hand for a long time, like he can’t remember what to do with it. Eventually he leans forward. Warriors shivers as their skin touches.</p><p> </p><p>“I was,” the not-man says. “Once.”</p><p> </p><p>“So what is he now?” Legend hisses. “Something more?”</p><p> </p><p>Sky makes an odd noise from beside the veteran. “They say in my time some gods are yet to be born.”</p><p> </p><p>“I will lead you,” says the not-man.</p><p> </p><p>“From the woods?” Warriors almost squeaks. “Or the—are you talking about our <em> quest </em>, because—”</p><p> </p><p>“I believe I belong among you,” says the not-man. “I can help.”</p><p> </p><p>Warriors swallows. “You’ll need a name, then. You can’t go by Link, that won’t really… work. In our group.” He waves a vague hand behind him.</p><p> </p><p>The not-man smiles again, ever so measured and careful. He makes a small motion. The shadows begin to rustle. A collection of awful, twisted wooden <em> scarecrows </em>emerge from behind trees and bushes and their own packs to dance in a ring around him. </p><p> </p><p>Wild chokes. Looking at them is like staring into the sun. His head <em> aches. </em>The creatures spin and twirl like mannequins on strings. Their eyes are huge and gold, smiles frozen. He hears gurgling and realises it’s laughter.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re welcome, kids,” says the not-man, amused, with that same small smile. The creatures clack against each other like wind chimes and scamper back into the trees, wobbling on limbs that bend backwards.</p><p> </p><p>“What’s he the god of, do you think?” Legend hisses in Wild’s ear.</p><p> </p><p>“Turning children into horrors,” Wild says back, panicked.</p><p> </p><p>“No, that’s a Lost Woods staple. This guy is something else entirely, I can feel it.”</p><p> </p><p>“Time,” says the not-man. Except it isn’t a <em> statement </em> , it’s a—it’s an <em> introduction. </em>“If I must be named new among you, I believe that will describe my actions satisfactorily.” He smiles. “It fits better than Link, at this point in my life, I think.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, fuck no,” Legend whispers. “No, please tell me we haven’t just stumbled across the cryptid <em> personification of time </em>.”</p><p> </p><p>Hyrule, on Wild’s other side, makes a considering noise. “He might help on our <em> time travelling quest </em>,” he says reasonably.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay,” says Warriors, visibly pulling himself together. “Welcome to the group, Time.”</p><p> </p><p>The not-man nods, once, then runs his blue eye over the group. Wild goes still. The right eye socket is bisected with a scar. Ethereal white light spills from the crack in the eyelid. The markings on his face are not just lines but delicate symbols. His face is lined. </p><p> </p><p>Eternity seems to freeze Wild in place. He feels like the rabbits he skins raw and impales on the cutting board when he makes stew. A breeze passes over him like cold water. He wonders, trembling, whether he is bound for the cookpot. Time’s gaze is heavier than iron.</p><p> </p><p>Then the god shifts, and the moment is broken. Wild notices his slate on the ground and scoops it up with trembling hands. It’s wet from the rain. He wipes it with his sleeve.</p><p> </p><p>The cracks are gone.</p><p> </p><p>What kind of magic song can heal even technology? Wild presses it into his chest and the tunic Zelda made for him. </p><p> </p><p>“Oh, gods,” says Legend.</p><p> </p><p>“This way,” the once-hero, once-Link, god of time tells them all, seeming to approve of what he sees in their souls. “The Lost Woods changes faces often. But I do not lose my way.”</p><p> </p><p>One by one, they follow him into the trees.</p>
