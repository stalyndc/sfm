	<p>We're here? We're live!? Hello!!!??</p>
	<p>It's been a while since the last time I had my own website and I'm not entirely sure yet what I wanna do with this place. So I just stuck with the kind of content my site had like, 15 years ago: (links to) my fic, art and fanvids, a little bio page, random fun stuff for my lovely visitors, optional background music, a guestbook... those kinds of things :3 I'm sure there's more to come in future.</p>
	<p>For now, I hope you have a nice time here and feel free to <s>like and subscribe</s> leave a note in the guestbook, before you leave!</p>

	<p>Been playing around with webdesign for a few days now and I think that idea of having my own homepage again might become reality sooner than I thought?</p>
	<p>I lost my old site around 2010 when freenet.de stopped offering free ad-free webspace and have missed it more than once since then. I've tried Wordpress but for some reason never really vibed with it ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>
	<p>Right now I'm reading through various tutorials and messing around with their code to refamiliarize myself again with html and get to know css a little better.</p>
	<p>As of typing this I'm working on the updates/news section and since I need more than one entry to really see what I'm doing... you get this pre-launch entry :P</p>
