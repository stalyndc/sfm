<p class="has-text-align-none">The Wisconsin Badgers have their first big test when they travel to Tuscaloosa to face the Alabama Crimson Tide in Week 3.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, headlines are already buzzing on both sides, as the Badgers had a dominant defensive performance in their 17-0 Week 1 win over Miami (OH), while the Crimson Tide was arguably the most disappointing team in the country with their 31-17 loss to the unranked Florida State Seminoles.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Alabama will almost certainly be a considerable favorite in that matchup, but there could be one personnel factor that will be beneficial for the Badgers. Crimson Tide starting running back Jam Miller injured his collarbone during a scrimmage before the season, and is expected to be out until the SEC opener, according to head coach Kalen DeBoer.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">&#8220;He&#8217;s a leader for us, a quiet leader, but somebody the players all respect,&#8221; DeBoer said about Miller, via ESPN. &#8220;Having that bye week, I feel good that he will be back out there. He does so many things for us at that position.&#8221;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">With that timeline, Miller should be ready for Week 5 for Alabama after their first bye week, but is expected to miss the contest against Wisconsin in Week 3.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Miller was effective in 2024, rushing for 668 yards and seven touchdowns as Alabama’s lead back. With him out and fellow running back Justice Haynes transferring to the Michigan Wolverines, the Crimson Tide is relying on  Kevin Riley, Richard Young, and Daniel Hill at running back, who were all reserves behind the top duo in 2024.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One player won’t make or break any game, but Miller had nine rushes for 71 yards and a touchdown against Wisconsin last year and would’ve been a focal part of the offense if available.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Wisconsin Badgers are back to work, preparing for Week 2, where they’ll take on the Middle Tennessee State Blue Raiders on Saturday, with kickoff slated for 3:00 p.m.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As the week begins, the biggest question regarding the Badgers is the availability of quarterback Billy Edwards, who suffered a non-contact lower-body injury in Week 1 and did not return. MRI results came back negative, with reports indicating the quarterback suffered a knee sprain and would be considered week-to-week.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On Monday, at his weekly press conference, head coach Luke Fickell provided some more information on the situation, noting that Wisconsin will likely go to Danny O’Neil at quarterback this week.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe that Billy (Edwards) will be playing,” Fickell said on Monday. “He didn&#8217;t practice, so obviously Danny (O’Neil) would be the guy we would go with, and Hunter (Simmons) would be the backup, and we&#8217;d just proceed from there.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Edwards went down in the second quarter of last Thursday’s win over Miami (OH) on a handoff attempt and was able to walk off the field on his own into the injury tent before later heading into the locker room. He rejoined his teammates in street clothes for the second half, indicating the injury wasn’t as bad as it looked, and the test results seem to indicate that as well.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, the Badgers are hoping to get their starting quarterback healthy soon, with the Alabama Crimson Tide coming up in Week 3, followed by a brutal conference slate.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But, for now, they’ll turn things over to Danny O’Neil for Week 2, with Hunter Simmons working as the backup.<br></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Fresh off a 17-0 victory over the Miami (OH) RedHawks in the season opener, the Wisconsin Badgers are taking on the Middle Tennessee State Blue Raiders in Week 2, with kickoff set for 3:00 p.m. at Camp Randall Stadium.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ahead of the contest, the Badgers revealed their depth chart for Week 2, which looks largely similar to their Week 1 depth chart, except for one change with the starters.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Badgers?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Badgers</a> depth chart for Week 2. <a href="https://t.co/W8ItFPIfEb">pic.twitter.com/W8ItFPIfEb</a></p>&mdash; Bucky’s 5th Quarter (@B5Q) <a href="https://twitter.com/B5Q/status/1962906911965118971?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 2, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At quarterback, Billy Edwards Jr. is still listed as the starter, indicating he’s week-to-week. However, it’ll be Danny O’Neil at the helm, with quarterback Hunter Simmons taking on the backup responsibilities, as Edwards recovers from a lower-body injury sustained in Week 1.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are no other changes on offense, but it’s notable to see how snaps actually played out in Week 1. Chris Brooks, Vinny Anthony, and Trech Kekahuna ended up playing the most receiver snaps of the group after being named starters. Behind them, it was Jayden Ballard, Tyrell Henry, and Eugene Hilton getting the majority of the reps.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At running back, Dilin Jones got the majority of the carries, rushing for 73 yards on 14 attempts. But, it was a more even split than the box score showed, as Jones had 31 snaps, while Darrion Dupree had 28 and Cade Yacamelli had 23.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At tight end, it was a fairly even split between Lance Mason and Jackson Acker, with Grant Stec getting a good portion of snaps as well. Wisconsin is going with more two tight end sets as we noted last week, so this group was expected to see a bump up in snaps as a whole.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Along the offensive line, the one position to watch is left tackle, as the Badgers did pull a struggling Davis Heinzen late for Leyton Nelson, who saw seven snaps at the end of the game. Heinzen was brought in via the transfer portal to start, but Wisconsin will need better play at left tackle going forward.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Defensively, Wisconsin made the lone change to their depth chart at outside linebacker, naming Tyreese Fearby as a co-starter with Sebastian Cheeks, with Corey Walker bumping to the second team. Fearby earned 12 snaps as a reserve last Thursday, while Walker got just five snaps in the win.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But, Cheeks and Mason Reiger were the clear leaders at outside linebacker, while Darryl Peterson still had a meaningful role with 22 snaps.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Along the defensive line, it makes sense to have quite a bit of ‘OR’s on the depth chart. Because Wisconsin rotated this group quite a bit, with the leader (Jay’Viar Suggs) playing 18 snaps. That led to fresher bodies and better overall play from the defensive line in Week 1.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At cornerback, though, Wisconsin mainly rotated at the spot outside Ricardo Hallman, with D’Yoni Hill and Omillio Agard splitting those snaps. In the nickel, Geimere Latimer was the clear starter, with Owen Arnett getting a few snaps at the end of the game.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Similarly, at safety, the Badgers primarily played their top two guys, with Austin Brown and Preston Zachman getting a lion’s share of the reps at the position.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Stay tuned for the rest of our coverage ahead of Wisconsin’s Week 2 game!</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Wisconsin Badgers had quite the weekend of volleyball, hosting the No. 14 Kansas Jayhawks and the No. 5 Texas Longhorns on Friday and Sunday, respectively, with both games being played at the Kohl Center.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Coming into the weekend after their 3-1 (25-23, 25-23, 23-25, 25-20) exhibition win over the Notre Dame Fighting Irish back on August 17th, the Badgers had two hard-fought matches, narrowly edging the Jayhawks 3-2 in a thriller on Friday evening.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Wisconsin took the first set comfortably 25-16, while Kansas rallied back to even things at one set apiece after a 25-18 second set. But, the Badgers bounced back with a dominant 11-2 run in the third set to get a lead over the Jayhawks, ultimately winning the set 25-18.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Of course, there had to be theatrics in the highly-contested match, as Kansas edged past Wisconsin with a 28-26 fourth set, leading to a fifth and final set, where the Badgers used a 5-1 run to win 15-10 and take the match 3-2 and get their first victory of the season.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The season opener featured double-doubles from four players: Mimi Colyer, Una Vajagic, Charlie Fuerbringer, and Kristen Simon.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Day 2 of the Opening Spike Classic proved to be a bit more challenging, as Texas was able to come into the Kohl Center and sweep the Badgers 29-27, 25-20, and 25-14.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It was a tough battle for the Badgers, who fell behind at several points in the match. While they had some encouraging rallies, especially in the first set, it wasn’t enough to unseat the Longhorns in any set, leading to a 1-1 weekend.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the latest AVCA polls, Wisconsin stayed put at No. 8, while Kansas dropped one spot to No. 15 and Texas climbed three places to No. 2.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Badgers have back-to-back matches on Thursday and Friday this week, as they take on UC Davis and Chicago State, respectively, at the Kohl Center. Their next opportunity for a ranked opponent will come next weekend, as they take on No. 22 Georgia Tech on the road next Friday.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Wisconsin Badgers made a statement in the season opener, shutting out the Miami (OH) RedHawks 17-0 with a dominant defensive performance.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While they did deal with an injury to starting quarterback Billy Edwards Jr., the senior is not expected to miss a considerable amount of time, with reports indicating that he suffered a knee sprain.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That led backup quarterback Danny O’Neil into action, and the sophomore threw for 120 yards, one touchdown, and one interception in his Badgers debut, settling in as the game went along.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">O’Neil will likely make his first start for the Badgers this upcoming week, with transfer Hunter Simmons elevating to the No. 2 role in Edwards’s absence.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Badgers will take on the Middle Tennessee State Blue Raiders in Week 2, with kickoff set for 3:00 p.m. at Camp Randall Stadium on Saturday. The latter struggled in a 34-14 loss last week to FCS Austin Peay. It was the first time since 1987 that Austin Peay had beaten an FBS team.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the loss, Middle Tennessee State completed just 2.9 yards per pass while throwing for 104 passing yards, while rushing for 44 yards on two yards per carry. They also gave up five sacks in the opener.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">How are the opening odds looking for Wisconsin in Week 2?</p>

<p><a href="https://sportsbook.fanduel.com/navigation/ncaaf">FanDuel Sportsbook</a> currently lists the Badgers as a 28.5-point favorite, with the over/under for total points currently set at 45.5 points. Wisconsin is a whopping -10000 favorite on the moneyline.</p>

<p>Obviously, that’s quite a wide spread for Wisconsin, but it’s understandable given how well their defense played in Week 1, and that their offense had good opportunities as well.</p>

<p>It will be the first time in program history that these two teams match up, and the Badgers will look to get a big blowout win after failing to cover the spread last weekend against Miami (OH).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Stay tuned for updates throughout the week as it’s time for Week 2!</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Wisconsin Badgers pitched a shutout in their season opener, winning 17-0 to start the season with a victory over the Miami (OH) RedHawks last Thursday.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, it wasn’t the prettiest victory, but Wisconsin held the RedHawks to just 117 yards of total offense, while forcing two turnovers and generating quite a few negative plays up front.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The stellar defensive performance caught the eyes of many nationally, including PFSN’s Cam Mellor, who graded the Badgers as the best defense in college football in Week 1 with a 96.4 grade.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That beat out the likes of the Oklahoma Sooners (95.5), West Virginia Mountaineers (95.1), BYU Cougars (95.1), Florida Gators (95.0), Vanderbilt Commodores (93.4), Houston Cougars (92.9), and others.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Wisconsin had a pressure rate of 44 percent, according to PFF, while keeping Miami (OH) to just 34 yards on the ground at a 1.5 yards-per-carry rate. They also didn’t allow a single third-down conversion on nine tries, one year after ranking 78th in the nation in the metric.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It was a thorough, dominant performance from the Badgers, which caught the eye of head coach Luke Fickell immediately.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I would say that obviously, defensively, that was a heck of a game,” Fickell said after the game. “I&#8217;m not singling out any one person. I haven&#8217;t even looked at the stats. It&#8217;s easy to say, obviously, [defensive coordinator] Mike Tressel and that defensive staff did a really good job in the preparations and really made some really good adjustments. I don&#8217;t know that maybe initially we expected the quarterback [Daequan Finn] to run the ball quite as much. And I think the first couple series, he came out and showed that they were willing to run the quarterback. And I thought our guys adapted, adjusted really well to that [and] played really well on third down. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I think hopefully that&#8217;s a great sign for us moving forward, as you can see, that we&#8217;ve done a much better job creating pressure [with] those guys up front creating havoc, whether they&#8217;re sacks or not. Sometimes that&#8217;s the most overrated stat in football. To me, it&#8217;s a little bit more about pressure, just getting the guys off the spots and being aggressive enough that those situations that you can always keep somebody not comfortable on their heels back there.  And I thought that&#8217;s where the defensive front did a really good job tonight. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“And then, what can you say about Preston Zachman? I think that a guy in his sixth year, it&#8217;s sometimes tough to say, ‘well, he&#8217;s gotten a lot better,’ but his confidence level, from what I&#8217;ve seen all through Fall Camp, showed tonight, and I&#8217;m excited for him. I&#8217;m proud of him. It wasn&#8217;t just the two picks. He&#8217;s really stepped up in his leadership and really has kind of taken a great grasp. I&#8217;ve always been a guy that, in particular, the leader of the defense comes from [the] interior and usually the linebacker [room], and it still can, and we have a collective group of leaders. But, there&#8217;s definitely a guy out in Preston that has done an unbelievable job at just being a really calm but aggressive leader.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Moving forward, the Badgers have a favorable matchup in Week 2 against a Middle Tennessee State team that had an ugly Week 1 showing in a 34-14 loss to FCS Austin Peay. That kickoff is set for 3:00 p.m. on Saturday at Camp Randall Stadium, where Wisconsin will look to build off their dominant defensive performance.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Wisconsin Badgers’ quarterback dilemma came early this year, as starter Billy Edwards Jr. suffered a knee sprain in the team’s season opener against Miami (OH) that initially looked worse than it ended up being.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Edwards, a senior transfer from Maryland, had gotten off to a solid start before suffering the injury on the team’s third drive. He is expected to miss some time, although there’s a chance he returns for Wisconsin’s Week 3 contest against the Alabama Crimson Tide.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Wisconsin has a new offense with a lot of new faces in 2025, with new offensive coordinator Jeff Grimes at the helm. Of the batch, who has the most to prove in 2025?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://sportsbook.fanduel.com/navigation/ncaab">In our weekly Reacts poll</a>, Edwards was the overwhelming answer, with 64 percent of fans voting for the quarterback.</p>
<img src="https://platform.buckys5thquarter.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/48/2025/09/Wisconsin_1_082625.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Others receiving votes include running back Dilin Jones and wideout Trech Kekahuna, but it makes sense why Edwards would be seen as the one with the most pressure.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After Wisconsin’s quarterback woes over the past few years, Edwards is looking to provide some stability in the room in the short term, which means both executing the offense and staying healthy. Of course, Wisconsin got some insurance by adding San Diego State transfer Danny O’Neil and Southern Illinois transfer Hunter Simmons in the portal.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But, in order for Wisconsin to reach its offensive potential, it needs Edwards under center, where things were starting to click in Week 1.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There was a wide range of opinions on what this game would look like on the field, with most seeming to favor a robust victory for the Wisconsin Badgers over the Miami (OH) RedHawks. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the <em><a href="https://www.buckys5thquarter.com/wisconsin-badgers-football-injuries/86190/wisconsin-badgers-football-news-starter-billy-edwards-jr-non-contact-injury" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Badger transfer quarterback injury curse</a> </em>reared its ugly head at Camp Randall on Thursday night and threw things into relative chaos. <a href="https://www.buckys5thquarter.com/wisconsin-badgers-football/86206/wisconsin-badgers-football-news-billy-edwards-injury-not-long-term-alabama-return" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I&#8217;ll try to bake Billy Edwards Jr. getting hurt</a> into this grading process a bit, but it won&#8217;t be a free pass for a generally underwhelming offensive performance.</p>
<div class="youtube-embed"><iframe title="A Costly Badgers win? Nick Osen Hops On To Grade Wisconsin&#039;s Victory Over Miami (OH)" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wQuqML8v-eM?rel=0" allowfullscreen allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture *; web-share *;"></iframe></div>
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>OFFENSE</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It&#8217;s easy to imagine a scenario where an Edwards helmed unit wears down the Redhawks and walks out with a four-score win, but the reality is that, into the second quarter, the offense looked functional, not dangerous.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In Jeff Grimes&#8217; defense, that was very common under Paul Chryst, even the ones with really good offenses. The second half is often where this style of attack shows out. But, Edwards went down, Danny O&#8217;Neil came in, and things were markedly up and down after that. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Positives: This resembles a traditional Wisconsin offense again. <a href="https://www.buckys5thquarter.com/wisconsin-badgers-football/86196/wisconsin-badgers-football-news-3-quick-takeaways-17-0-win-miami-oh" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">You can see Grimes&#8217; plan coming into focus, and that&#8217;s very heartening</a>. The running backs, especially Dilin Jones, very much looked the part, and O&#8217;Neil showed enough moxie to allow one to rest easy-ish knowing he&#8217;ll be starting games for a while. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There were also moments from the wide receiver and tight end rooms that flashed potential, and I liked what I saw from Grant Stec (<a href="https://x.com/jessetemple/status/1961405926339911700" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">94.8 PFF grade</a>) and Chris Brooks, two dudes that weren&#8217;t on many Badger Bingo cards a week ago. The quick passing game looked, ironically, better than under Longo. Trech Kekahuna is going to be a valuable weapon in 2025.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Negatives: Left tackle is a problem, and I don&#8217;t think Luke Fickell, in good conscience, can roll with Davis Heinzen going forward. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That doesn&#8217;t mean the kid doesn&#8217;t work hard or can&#8217;t get better, but if that had been a Top-25 defensive unit, he might have given up double-digit sacks. This will be the biggest challenge of the week, since Leyton Nelson, the next man up at LT, is better in pass protection but isn&#8217;t the run blocker Heinzen is. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The lack of a Badger downfield passing attack against a relatively soft Miami defense was also suboptimal. I no longer subscribe to the &#8220;they were saving their cool plays for later games&#8221; bit. The offense will have to be more explosive, even with O&#8217;Neil, or the run game will get bottled up. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">GRADE: C+</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>DEFENSE</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A lot was made of the transfers coming in for the Badgers, especially along the defensive line, and game one showed some very positive early returns. Pitching a shutout against a former All-MAC quarterback is impressive, and giving up only 117 yards (34 rushing)&#8211;the squad&#8217;s best effort since 2017&#8211;<a href="https://www.si.com/college/wisconsin/football/badgers-defense-ranks-no-1-analytics-week-1-miami-oh" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was a bold statement.</a></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Positives: It&#8217;s one game, but there didn&#8217;t appear to be an obvious weakness in this unit. In 2024, there were glaring issues, and those look to be gone or at least improved upon. A bigger, stouter defensive line made it nearly impossible for the Redhawks to run, and a solid pass rush (the three sacks were almost 25% of last season&#8217;s total) bode well for the stiffer tests to come. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Mason Reiger is going to be a problem for opponents this fall. While the Badgers will face better passing attacks, I loved how they locked down Miami quarterback Dequan Finn. Big Ten Defensive Player of the Week Preston Zachman (94.0 PFF grade) was a heat-seeking missile, and it&#8217;s possible that safety becomes a strength in this defense. (NOTE: Adding Nyzier Fourqurean would obviously help the secondary, but counting on him playing is probably a mistake.)  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Negatives: Honestly, there weren&#8217;t many. Yes, you&#8217;d like to have more sacks than your MAC opponent, but a porous offensive line wasn&#8217;t Mike Tressel&#8217;s fault. I&#8217;m very interested to see this unit perform against a better offense, and Alabama will provide a stiff test in two weeks.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">GRADE: A</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>SPECIAL TEAMS</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This was one to watch, given that the kicker battle waged until the end of camp, but, oddly, punting was the lowlight of the evening.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Positives:<a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/hWXkLStM7Cg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Nathaniel Vakos nailing a 42-yard FG</a> with plenty of room to spare was a nice opening salvo. Having a reliable leg would be a massive boost for the Badgers, but I&#8217;m not sure why Vakos wasn&#8217;t given a chance from 54 yards out on a later drive. Punting from the opponent&#8217;s 37 was a common Paul Chryst meme.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Negatives: Atticus Bertrams was probably Wisconsin&#8217;s most steady performer in 2024, so a lot is expected of him this season, but opening night was not kind to the Aussie, averaging only 38 yards a punt with a sub-31 net. That said, this will probably be his worst game of the season, as he&#8217;s a talented dude.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">GRADE: B-</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>COACHING</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Between the chaos of losing Edwards, to playing a middling opponent, it&#8217;s a bit hard to get a read on the staff&#8217;s evening, but the overall vibes were pretty good.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Positives: The traditional Badger offense is back, or at least on the way. It&#8217;s not hard to imagine this unit improving as the season goes on, but the offensive line issues will be a huge factor in how good it will be. The defense was very well-prepared and generally manhandled an inferior opponent. There was a nice mix of blitzes, and I&#8217;m really excited to see Zachman and Reiger continue to be unleashed by Tressel.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Negatives: There were a few head scratchers, including the already-noted decision punt with a big-legged kicker available for a long field goal, and also <a href="https://www.espn.com/video/clip/_/id/46100632" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">going for it on fourth down when Vakos was well in range</a>. These are a bit nitpicky, but there were audible groans in the stadium when the punt unit was brought on with the Badgers on Miami&#8217;s 37 and for good reason.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">GRADE: B</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>OVERALL</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A 17-point win over a top-table MAC team in a game where your starting quarterback goes down early in the second quarter seems like a solid result. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While it was far from perfect, this game gave tantalizing glimpses into the Badgers&#8217; upgraded talent, system, and culture. <a href="https://x.com/barryisthedon/status/1961308640465305890" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">As I noted on X, had the score been 34-17, more fans would have been excited about it</a>, which I find kind of funny. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Going forward, I&#8217;d like to see Edwards, Jr. back as soon as possible (sources say this won&#8217;t be a long-term injury), but I feel better about O&#8217;Neil starting than I did about Locke in 2024. Low bar, yes, but very important. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">GRADE: B</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One week down, one award for the Wisconsin Badgers. Specifically, safety Preston Zachman, who was named the Big Ten Defensive Player of the Week on Monday after recording two interceptions against the Miami (OH) RedHawks last Thursday.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Zachman, a senior, returned for one last season of college football and was set to be one of the key pieces on the team in 2025. He returned with Austin Brown to form a strong safety duo for the 2025 season, and started off the season strong with his two-interception performance on Thursday.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Zachman nearly returned his first interception for a touchdown, picking off Miami (OH) quarterback Daequan Finn deep in RedHawks territory. The Badgers eventually punched the drive in for a touchdown with a Danny O’Neil quarterback sneak.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">His second interception, however, may have been more impressive, as the safety had a great read on the ball, breaking hard and making a diving catch to rob Miami (OH) of a potential explosive.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Thursday was Zachman’s seventh interception of his career, as the safety had picked up two in each of the last two seasons.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Overall, there was an increased level of aggressiveness from Wisconsin’s defense, which led to negative plays, limited explosives, and Zachman’s turnovers.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I think that just shows confidence playing it, just letting it loose and flying around,” Zachman said about the difference from 2024. “We had a lot of guys rally into the football, and you kind of know that you can just be aggressive and take your shot knowing that your brother&#8217;s right there next to you. They&#8217;re rallying with the football.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, the Badgers will look to continue the effort next week when they face the Middle Tennessee State Blue Raiders at home in their second non-conference game of the season.<br><br></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Wisconsin Badgers beat the Miami (OH) RedHawks in a 17-0 shutout to start the season, getting through some adversity with a strong defensive performance.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While it wasn’t the prettiest game, there was much to take away from the game, as several players made their mark, while others disappointed in the season opener.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Whose stock is up and whose stock is down after the season opener?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="suNUnN">Stock Up: Sebastian Cheeks</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Outside linebacker Mason Reiger’s stock was already high after a strong showing during fall camp. And he proved that with a great complementary performance on Thursday, stopping the run at a high level, while constantly generating pressure as a pass-rusher.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But, nobody improved their stock more in the outside linebacker room than Sebastian Cheeks, who was dominant in the opener.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Cheeks was a constant presence up front, showing good effort, edge-setting ability, and even getting pressure on the quarterback. After moving to outside linebacker last offseason, Cheeks was seen as a pass-rushing specialist.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But, he’s bulked up and now is a three-down player, having good pursuit and good edge setting for quarterback contains, while also teeing up off the edge alongside Reiger. That duo should be a big positive for Wisconsin this season.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="vnTP20">Stock Down: Davis Heinzen at LT</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of the biggest question marks heading into the season was who would play at left tackle after Kevin Heywood’s torn ACL in the spring. Former Vanderbilt transfer Leyton Nelson struggled when stepping up with the first-team offense back in the spring, which led to guard Joe Brunner getting some reps at tackle.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That led Wisconsin to nab Central Michigan transfer Davis Heinzen in the spring transfer portal, hoping to get some experience at the position.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Then, in the fall, the Badgers tested out a few options, with Brunner, Heinzen, and guard-turned-tackle J.P. Benzschawel getting reps before Wisconsin settled on Heinzen.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Well, the left tackle really struggled in Week 1, both in pass protection and in the run game, albeit much more in the former. He gave up five pressures and two sacks, according to PFF, but there just didn’t seem to be any stability on the left side for quarterback Danny O’Neil.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Wisconsin did pull Heinzen late for Leyton Nelson, who got the final seven snaps of the game. They face Middle Tennessee State this week, and there may need to be some conversations about moving around the offensive line, given the daunting schedule ahead of the Badgers this season.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Wisconsin could move Brunner out to left tackle, but they don’t have much depth either at tackle or on the interior, raising questions as to who their five best linemen could be.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="WYUFcR">Stock Up: Christian Alliegro</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Wisconsin has had experience, but not really much consistency, over the past few years at linebacker, where the standard of play has certainly dropped from the program’s historical record.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Well, Christian Alliegro had a strong start to the year as the team’s lead linebacker, making plays and showing off his athleticism and versatility. Now, everything wasn’t clean: Alliegro had a bad edge set on the defense’s third drive that allowed a run to kick out to the edge, which was an issue for the defense last year. He also missed a tackle that would’ve led to a sack on a well-timed linebacker blitz.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But, the linebacker wrapped up well on open field tackles, making some major momentum plays there, including a big sack as quarterback Daequan Finn escaped the pocket, and finished with four tackles.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s Week 1 against an opponent Wisconsin needed to beat convincingly, but I like what I saw from the linebacker play on Thursday.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="suNUnN">Stock Down: Atticus Bertrams’s shank</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Badgers have dealt with special teams woes over the past few years. So, it wasn’t pretty to see Atticus Bertrams shank his first punt, which went for only 20 yards and gave the RedHawks prime field position early in the game.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, the defense settled in, and Bertrams punted well enough afterwards, averaging 42.5 yards per punt outside of the miss, but consistency needs to be there for the Badgers punter.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="WYUFcR">Stock Up: Jeff Grimes’s creativity</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We didn’t get to see the full look after Billy Edwards’s injury, but Jeff Grimes’s offense is trending up after Week 1.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There were quite a few players who got a touch, with Grimes mixing up the run game to involve receivers and running backs, and he had the right adjustments early after a quick punt.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Understanding Miami’s initial aggressiveness against the run, Grimes began to dial up the quick passing game, which Billy Edwards executed well, moving the ball down the field. That opened up the run game, with the creativity showing from Grimes.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It may be a while before Edwards gets back under center, but you can see the potential of this offense when things are going well and if those deep shots start to hit.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="suNUnN">Stock Up: Brandon Lane</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After transferring in last offseason, Brandon Lane didn’t have as big a role as initially expected. Then, Wisconsin brought in a boatload of transfers this offseason, raising questions about where Lane fits in this year.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Well, that’s with the starters, as Lane was a force on Thursday, especially as a pass-rusher, where he was able to drive interior linemen back into the pocket and make things uncomfortable for quarterback Daequan Finn.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Wisconsin rotated a ton, but Lane was second amongst defensive linemen in snaps and seems to be a regular in the rotation going forward.</p>
