              <h1 class="h3 fw-bold mb-3">How to Turn Any Website into a Feed with SimpleFeedMaker</h1>
              <p class="lead text-secondary mb-4">Whether you manage a professional reading list or want alerts from a single landing page, SimpleFeedMaker converts any public URL into a clean RSS or JSON feed in minutes. This guide walks you through the process.</p>

              <h2 class="h5 fw-semibold">1. Collect the URL you want to monitor</h2>
              <p>Identify the page that updates with the content you care about: a blog category, a newsroom, a documentation changelog, or even a job listings grid. Make sure it is publicly accessible and loads without authentication. Copy the full URL directly from your browser.</p>

              <h2 class="h5 fw-semibold">2. Generate your feed</h2>
              <ol class="page-list mb-4">
                <li>Visit <a class="link-light" href="/">SimpleFeedMaker.com</a>.</li>
                <li>Paste the URL into the <strong>Source URL</strong> field.</li>
                <li>Adjust the <strong>Items</strong> count to match how many posts you want to keep in the feed. Ten is a great starting point for most sites.</li>
                <li>Choose your preferred <strong>Format</strong> (RSS for broad compatibility, JSON Feed for modern apps).</li>
                <li>Enable <strong>Prefer native feed</strong> if you want us to auto-detect first-party feeds when they exist.</li>
                <li>Click <strong>Generate feed</strong>. Within seconds the result card displays your feed URL along with quick copy buttons.</li>
              </ol>

              <p>If the site already advertises a native RSS or Atom feed, SimpleFeedMaker surfaces that URL automatically. Otherwise our parser crawls the page, extracts article blocks, and builds a normalized feed with titles, descriptions, links, and publication timestamps.</p>

              <h2 class="h5 fw-semibold">3. Test the feed in your reader</h2>
              <p>Before sharing the feed, subscribe from your own reader of choice—Feedbin, Inoreader, NetNewsWire, Readwise Reader, or any app that handles RSS or JSON Feed. Confirm that the latest items arrive intact and click through to ensure the links point to the correct destination. Because we cache content server-side, performance remains quick even if the source website is occasionally slow.</p>

              <h2 class="h5 fw-semibold">4. Share or automate</h2>
              <p>Once you are satisfied with the feed, put it to work:</p>
              <ul class="page-list mb-4">
                <li><strong>Internal digests:</strong> Drop the feed into Slack or Microsoft Teams to broadcast updates to your team.</li>
                <li><strong>Newsletters:</strong> Pipe the feed into tools like Mailbrew or MailerLite to curate weekly roundups automatically.</li>
                <li><strong>Automation:</strong> Use Zapier, Make, or n8n to push new items to databases, spreadsheets, or social posts.</li>
                <li><strong>Syndication:</strong> Share the feed link with your community so fans can subscribe in their favorite app.</li>
              </ul>

              <h2 class="h5 fw-semibold">5. Keep feeds tidy</h2>
              <p>Feeds generated by SimpleFeedMaker refresh automatically, but it’s good practice to review them every few weeks. If the source site changes its layout, you can regenerate a fresh feed in seconds. You can also create multiple feeds for separate sections of the same site to keep topics organized.</p>

              <h2 class="h5 fw-semibold">Troubleshooting tips</h2>
              <p>Most pages work out of the box. If you run into unexpected results:</p>
              <ul class="page-list">
                <li><strong>Pagination:</strong> Some catalogs load more items with infinite scroll. Grab a URL that lists the most recent entries without manual scrolling, or use the site’s “all posts” archive.</li>
                <li><strong>Paywalls:</strong> We only parse publicly accessible content. If the page requires login, you’ll need to syndicate a public summary page instead.</li>
                <li><strong>Frequency:</strong> For extremely busy sites, lower the item count so readers aren’t overwhelmed with hundreds of entries at once.</li>
              </ul>

              <p class="mb-0">That’s it—you now have a dependable feed for any site you follow. Ready to build your next one? <a class="link-light" href="/">Jump back to the generator</a> and turn another source into a feed.</p>
