<p class="lead text-secondary mb-4">Monetizing with Google AdSense is easier when your site looks alive, useful, and trustworthy. A thoughtful RSS strategy helps you prove all three, so reviewers see consistent publishing signals the moment they land on your blog.</p>

<h2 class="h5 fw-semibold">Understand what AdSense reviewers look for</h2>
<p>Google checks for original content, clear navigation, and policies that protect readers. Before you apply, skim the <a class="link-light" href="https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/9724" rel="noopener" target="_blank">AdSense program policies</a> and translate them into a simple checklist for your team.</p>
<ul class="page-list mb-4">
  <li><strong>Original articles:</strong> Aim for 800+ words that answer a real question or deliver how-to guidance.</li>
  <li><strong>Coherent navigation:</strong> Make sure About, Contact, and Privacy pages are visible from every post.</li>
  <li><strong>Policy coverage:</strong> Publish privacy and cookie notices that mention advertising partners.</li>
  <li><strong>Fast loading:</strong> Optimize images and defer scripts so reviewers see a responsive page.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="h5 fw-semibold">Stabilize your publishing cadence</h2>
<p>A quiet blog is the number one reason AdSense applications get delayed. Create a lightweight editorial calendar that mixes evergreen guides, opinion pieces, and quick tutorials. Consistency carries more weight than raw volume—two polished uploads per week are better than a burst of four posts followed by silence.</p>
<p>Use SimpleFeedMaker to generate both RSS and JSON feeds for your new articles. Submit them to your favourite scheduling app so the whole team sees upcoming deadlines, and connect the RSS feed to a private Slack channel for accountability.</p>

<h2 class="h5 fw-semibold">Design posts that read well for humans and crawlers</h2>
<p>AdSense reviewers evaluate the same pages that search crawlers see, so clarity matters. Structure every article with descriptive headings, short paragraphs, and internal links to relevant resources.</p>
<ul class="page-list mb-4">
  <li><strong>Lead with the takeaway:</strong> A strong introduction tells busy readers exactly what they gain.</li>
  <li><strong>Use media thoughtfully:</strong> Compress screenshots, add descriptive captions, and credit original sources.</li>
  <li><strong>Highlight next steps:</strong> Close each section with a tangible action or resource link.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="h5 fw-semibold">Showcase trust signals reviewers can verify</h2>
<p>Transparent publishing wins trust. Maintain an author bio for every contributor, list at least one business address or contact form, and link to social profiles where readers can reach you. If you offer downloadable assets or templates, host them on your domain and describe how you handle subscriber data.</p>
<p>An RSS feed also doubles as proof of freshness: reviewers can scan the timestamps and see that your updates aren’t copy/pasted.</p>

<h2 class="h5 fw-semibold">Document your monetization roadmap</h2>
<p>Publish a short disclosure page that outlines how you plan to use AdSense alongside any affiliate or sponsorship placements. Being upfront about your business model reduces the chance of follow-up questions from the policy team.</p>
<p>Keep the blog experience clean today, but reserve space in your layout where ad units will live. That way you can switch them on immediately after approval without redesigning key templates.</p>

<h2 class="h5 fw-semibold">Automate sanity checks before you apply</h2>
<p>Run your AdSense checklist once a week. Verify there are no placeholder pages, that outbound links still work, and that your feeds display the ten most recent posts without errors. Tools like our <a class="link-light" href="/blog/feed.xml">RSS feed</a> and <a class="link-light" href="/blog/feed.xml?format=json">JSON feed</a> make it easy to monitor uptime from a third-party service.</p>
<p>When everything looks solid for at least 30 days, capture screenshots, submit your application, and note the date in a shared tracker.</p>

<h2 class="h5 fw-semibold">Keep momentum after approval</h2>
<p>Once ads begin rendering, pay attention to reader experience. Gradually test placement, keep the ratio of ads to content reasonable, and continue to publish thoughtful pieces that serve your audience. AdSense works best as a complement to email sponsorships, digital products, or consulting offers you highlight at the end of each article.</p>

<p class="mb-0">The fastest way to gain AdSense approval is to behave like a publication that already has it. Show reviewers a helpful content library, transparent policies, and a steady cadence of RSS-powered updates—and you will stand out in the queue.</p>

<p class="lead text-secondary mb-4">RSS may feel like a veteran technology, but its reliability, openness, and portability make it more valuable than ever for publishers who want to reach people without being locked into algorithms.</p>

<h2 class="h5 fw-semibold">Open distribution beats walled gardens</h2>
<p>Every platform tweak forces creators to relearn how to reach their audience. RSS, on the other hand, is a stable contract between you and your readers. When someone subscribes to your feed, you own that relationship forever. There is no mysterious ranking system, throttled reach, or unpredictable moderation queue. Readers decide when to unsubscribe, not a black box recommender.</p>
<p>For newsrooms and solo bloggers alike, that autonomy matters. RSS makes it trivial to syndicate the same updates to newsletters, Slack channels, Telegram bots, or podcast show notes. A single canonical feed becomes the distribution backbone across every channel you activate.</p>

<h2 class="h5 fw-semibold">Feeds power the modern research stack</h2>
<p>Professional researchers, analysts, and curators still rely on feed readers because they can harvest primary sources faster than any social network. Tools like Readwise Reader, Feedbin, and NetNewsWire summarize and archive hundreds of sources with minimal friction. When companies need competitive intelligence or academics track new publications, custom feeds turn the firehose into a manageable stream.</p>
<p>With SimpleFeedMaker, that capability extends to any public web page—even when a publisher doesn’t offer RSS themselves. Editors simply paste a URL, generate the feed, and drop it into their existing reader workflow. The result is a truly personalized research dashboard.</p>

<h2 class="h5 fw-semibold">Feeds respect your audience’s attention</h2>
<p>RSS delivers content exactly when a reader is ready to consume it, instead of interrupting them with notifications or autoplaying video. That makes feeds accessible for neurodiverse audiences, professionals working in focus mode, and anyone who prefers asynchronous updates. When subscribers use their own reader, they receive your headlines without invasive tracking pixels or bloated scripts.</p>
<ul class="page-list mb-4">
  <li><strong>Predictable cadence:</strong> Readers can triage their feeds once a day or once a week without fear of missing important updates.</li>
  <li><strong>Archivable content:</strong> A feed acts as a timeline that your subscribers can search, annotate, and export for later reference.</li>
  <li><strong>Privacy first:</strong> No cookies or pixels are required for delivery, which keeps you aligned with modern privacy regulations.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="h5 fw-semibold">Search engines still index feeds</h2>
<p>Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo continuously scan RSS and Atom feeds to discover new pages. Submitting a feed in Search Console or the IndexNow initiative gives crawlers a direct signal whenever you publish. That means faster discovery for new posts, products, and documentation updates without having to wait for the crawler to stumble across your site.</p>

<h2 class="h5 fw-semibold">The ecosystem keeps evolving</h2>
<p>Podcasting, Mastodon, and newsletter platforms all rely on feed technology under the hood. Podcast apps ingest RSS with custom namespaces for audio enclosures. ActivityPub exposes followable feeds for federated social accounts. Even platforms like Substack export RSS to keep creators portable. When you invest in high-quality feeds today, you automatically gain compatibility with tomorrow’s publishing tools.</p>

<h2 class="h5 fw-semibold">How SimpleFeedMaker keeps RSS frictionless</h2>
<p>Our generator fetches the target page, identifies structured content, and produces a clean RSS or JSON feed in seconds. Auto-discovery detects first-party feeds, while the crawler falls back to article extraction when needed. We cache results for performance and provide permanent URLs so subscribers can trust the feed right away.</p>
<p>The best part? You don’t need to manage servers or write scraping code. SimpleFeedMaker handles the hard parts and hands you a production-ready feed URL. That makes it the perfect companion for curators, community teams, and marketing managers who need fresh sources without development overhead.</p>

<h2 class="h5 fw-semibold">Your publishing stack deserves dependable feeds</h2>
<p>If you want to build direct relationships with readers, an email list and a high-quality feed are non-negotiable. RSS remains the most resilient way to deliver those updates without surrendering control to a platform. Whether you manage a newsroom or a niche blog, start generating feeds for every important source today and let your readers choose the tools that work best for them.</p>

<p class="lead text-secondary mb-4">Whether you manage a professional reading list or want alerts from a single landing page, SimpleFeedMaker converts any public URL into a clean RSS or JSON feed in minutes. This guide walks you through the process.</p>

<h2 class="h5 fw-semibold">1. Collect the URL you want to monitor</h2>
<p>Identify the page that updates with the content you care about: a blog category, a newsroom, a documentation changelog, or even a job listings grid. Make sure it is publicly accessible and loads without authentication. Copy the full URL directly from your browser.</p>

<h2 class="h5 fw-semibold">2. Generate your feed</h2>
<ol class="page-list mb-4">
  <li>Visit <a class="link-light" href="/">SimpleFeedMaker.com</a>.</li>
  <li>Paste the URL into the <strong>Source URL</strong> field.</li>
  <li>Adjust the <strong>Items</strong> count to match how many posts you want to keep in the feed. Ten is a great starting point for most sites.</li>
  <li>Choose your preferred <strong>Format</strong> (RSS for broad compatibility, JSON Feed for modern apps).</li>
  <li>Enable <strong>Prefer native feed</strong> if you want us to auto-detect first-party feeds when they exist.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Generate feed</strong>. Within seconds the result card displays your feed URL along with quick copy buttons.</li>
</ol>

<h2 class="h5 fw-semibold">3. Test the feed in your reader</h2>
<p>Before sharing the feed, subscribe from your own reader of choice—Feedbin, Inoreader, NetNewsWire, Readwise Reader, or any app that handles RSS or JSON Feed. Confirm that the latest items arrive intact and click through to ensure the links point to the correct destination. Because we cache content server-side, performance remains quick even if the source website is occasionally slow.</p>

<h2 class="h5 fw-semibold">4. Share or automate</h2>
<p>Once you are satisfied with the feed, put it to work:</p>
<ul class="page-list mb-4">
  <li><strong>Internal digests:</strong> Drop the feed into Slack or Microsoft Teams to broadcast updates to your team.</li>
  <li><strong>Newsletters:</strong> Pipe the feed into tools like Mailbrew or MailerLite to curate weekly roundups automatically.</li>
  <li><strong>Automation:</strong> Use Zapier, Make, or n8n to push new items to databases, spreadsheets, or social posts.</li>
  <li><strong>Syndication:</strong> Share the feed link with your community so fans can subscribe in their favorite app.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="h5 fw-semibold">5. Keep feeds tidy</h2>
<p>Feeds generated by SimpleFeedMaker refresh automatically, but it’s good practice to review them every few weeks. If the source site changes its layout, you can regenerate a fresh feed in seconds. You can also create multiple feeds for separate sections of the same site to keep topics organized.</p>

<h2 class="h5 fw-semibold">Troubleshooting tips</h2>
<p>Most pages work out of the box. If you run into unexpected results:</p>
<ul class="page-list">
  <li><strong>Pagination:</strong> Some catalogs load more items with infinite scroll. Grab a URL that lists the most recent entries without manual scrolling, or use the site’s “all posts” archive.</li>
  <li><strong>Paywalls:</strong> We only parse publicly accessible content. If the page requires login, you’ll need to syndicate a public summary page instead.</li>
  <li><strong>Frequency:</strong> For extremely busy sites, lower the item count so readers aren’t overwhelmed with hundreds of entries at once.</li>
</ul>

<p class="lead text-secondary mb-4">RSS 2.0 has powered the web for two decades, while JSON Feed offers a modern take on the same syndication ideas. Understanding how each format works helps you deliver the best experience to your subscribers.</p>

<h2 class="h5 fw-semibold">RSS 2.0 at a glance</h2>
<p>RSS is an XML-based standard that organizes channel metadata—title, link, description—followed by a list of items. Each item includes its own title, link, publication date, and optional fields such as author, categories, or media enclosures. Because RSS has existed since 2002, virtually every feed reader, podcast app, and automation toolkit can parse it without additional work.</p>
<ul class="page-list mb-4">
  <li><strong>Strengths:</strong> Excellent compatibility, namespaced extensions (like <code>itunes:</code> for podcasts), and built-in support for enclosures.</li>
  <li><strong>Considerations:</strong> XML can be verbose, and writing custom integrations often requires DOM parsing or XPath.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="h5 fw-semibold">JSON Feed in brief</h2>
<p>JSON Feed, introduced in 2017, reimagines syndication with a JSON structure. It mirrors the same concepts as RSS—feed metadata plus an array of items—but the familiar key-value format makes it easier for developers to consume. Common properties like <code>title</code>, <code>content_html</code>, and <code>date_published</code> map directly to JSON data types, which simplifies building modern web and mobile integrations.</p>
<ul class="page-list mb-4">
  <li><strong>Strengths:</strong> Lightweight payloads, effortless parsing in JavaScript or serverless functions, and native support for multiple authors without XML namespaces.</li>
  <li><strong>Considerations:</strong> Reader support is still growing, so legacy apps may not understand JSON Feed yet.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="h5 fw-semibold">How SimpleFeedMaker handles both</h2>
<p>When you paste a URL on SimpleFeedMaker, you can choose RSS or JSON Feed. Behind the scenes we extract the same content model—title, link, summary, body, author—and then render it through the desired format. That means you can provide RSS for compatibility while offering JSON Feed to developer audiences or modern readers.</p>
<p>We recommend publishing both formats whenever possible. RSS satisfies long-time subscribers, while JSON Feed makes it simple for product teams to integrate your updates into dashboards, native apps, or microservices without wrestling with XML.</p>

<h2 class="h5 fw-semibold">Choosing the right format for your audience</h2>
<p>If you need a single answer, start with RSS—it remains the lowest common denominator. Add JSON Feed when you want to collaborate with developer communities, automate workflows, or provide ultra-fast API responses. Because SimpleFeedMaker maintains the same feed ID across formats, you can swap between them or offer both without duplicating work.</p>
<p class="mb-0">Whichever format you choose, the goal is the same: deliver timely content that respects your reader’s attention. <a class="link-light" href="/">Generate a feed now</a> and make sure your audience has a format they love.</p>
