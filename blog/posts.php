<p class="lead text-secondary mb-4">Our mission at SimpleFeedMaker is to keep your feeds fresh, fast, and fuss-free. Over the past few weeks we focused on tightening the operational playbook, refreshing privacy transparency, and teeing up the next wave of user-facing improvements. Here’s the rundown.</p>

<h2 class="h5 fw-semibold">Recent Enhancements</h2>

<h3 class="h6 fw-semibold text-secondary text-uppercase mt-4 mb-2">Automation &amp; Ops Playbook</h3>
<p>We shipped an expanded <a class="link-light" href="/AGENTS.md">Automation, Security, and Operations Playbook</a> that documents every maintenance agent—from Secrets Guard to the quarterly Disaster Drill. Each entry now includes triggers, scripts, and remediation checklists, so anyone on the team can run the same trusted process.</p>

<h3 class="h6 fw-semibold text-secondary text-uppercase mt-4 mb-2">Health Monitoring Clarity</h3>
<p>The <strong>Health Sentry</strong> guide now matches the JSON returned by <code>/health.php</code>. Monitors can watch the top-level <code>ok</code> or <code>status</code> fields instead of chasing nested values, which cuts down on false alarms and surfaces real downtime faster.</p>

<h3 class="h6 fw-semibold text-secondary text-uppercase mt-4 mb-2">Privacy Policy Refresh</h3>
<p>We updated the privacy page to reflect our current analytics setup. SimpleFeedMaker loads Google Analytics strictly for aggregate usage stats—no ad features, no sharing. If you’d rather block the script, the app still works exactly the same. We also reiterated how operational logs stay private and why they matter for keeping abusers out.</p>

<h2 class="h5 fw-semibold mt-5">What We’re Building Next</h2>

<ul class="page-list mb-4">
  <li><strong>Saved history &amp; one-click refreshes.</strong> A “recent jobs” tray will remember your last successful feeds so you can regenerate them without retyping anything.</li>
  <li><strong>Preview parsed items.</strong> Power users will see the first batch of extracted entries—plus validation warnings—before committing to generate a feed file.</li>
  <li><strong>Richer native-feed context.</strong> When SimpleFeedMaker passes through an official feed, we’ll show the discovered URL, feed title, and last-modified timestamp right in the results.</li>
  <li><strong>Operator visibility.</strong> Lightweight metrics (top warnings, last refresh success) are headed to a dashboard so you can spot problem feeds without tailing logs.</li>
  <li><strong>CI secrets guardrails.</strong> We’re preparing to run Secrets Guard during GitHub Actions builds once template secure files are available in automation.</li>
</ul>

<p class="mb-0">SimpleFeedMaker runs on a lean stack, but the site keeps evolving thanks to your feedback. If you hit tricky source pages or have feature ideas, drop us a note—and keep an eye on the blog for the next wave of improvements.</p>

<p class="lead text-secondary mb-4">The fastest way to earn trust from readers, collaborators, and distribution partners is to look like a publication that already has its act together. A steady RSS feed makes that evidence easy to see.</p>

<h2 class="h5 fw-semibold">Clarify the purpose of your blog</h2>
<p>Write a short editorial mission that spells out who you serve and what you cover. This anchors every decision—from topics you accept to the tone you use. Keep the statement visible on your About page and revisit it quarterly to confirm it still feels true.</p>

<h2 class="h5 fw-semibold">Build a sustainable publishing rhythm</h2>
<p>Healthy blogs publish at a predictable pace. Map a light calendar that alternates deep guides, quick wins, and opinion pieces. Two polished updates per week are enough to show momentum without overloading your team. Use your RSS feed to broadcast deadlines in Slack or Notion so contributors stay aligned.</p>

<h2 class="h5 fw-semibold">Craft articles that respect the reader</h2>
<p>People decide whether to return based on clarity. Structure each post with descriptive headings, scannable paragraphs, and practical takeaways. Pepper in internal links to related pieces and highlight quotes that deliver instant value for skimmers.</p>

<ul class="page-list mb-4">
  <li><strong>Lead with the outcome:</strong> Open with the problem you solve and what readers gain by the end.</li>
  <li><strong>Use supporting media:</strong> Compress images, add alt text, and caption charts so the context is obvious.</li>
  <li><strong>Invite action:</strong> Close each section with a prompt—download a checklist, try a workflow, or share feedback.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="h5 fw-semibold">Showcase the humans behind the site</h2>
<p>Authenticity matters. Publish staff bios, list a clear contact path, and link to the communities where you actively participate. If you curate guest contributors, add short intros that explain why their perspective matters.</p>

<h2 class="h5 fw-semibold">Keep a public changelog of improvements</h2>
<p>A lightweight changelog signals that you maintain the site intentionally. Note when you refresh templates, tighten accessibility, or launch new sections. Link the changelog from your footer so visitors and partners can see continuous progress.</p>

<h2 class="h5 fw-semibold">Use RSS as your proof of consistency</h2>
<p>Your feed tells a story about cadence, quality, and freshness. Submit it to newsletter tools, discovery platforms, and private dashboards your team watches. When collaborators ask how active you are, you can share a single URL that showcases your latest work.</p>

<h2 class="h5 fw-semibold">Run a weekly quality review</h2>
<p>Set aside thirty minutes to audit recent posts. Check for typos, update screenshots, and confirm every call-to-action still makes sense. Review analytics alongside your feed to spot topics that resonate and gaps you still need to cover.</p>

<p class="mb-0">Treat your blog like a living publication. Pair a clear mission with reliable publishing, thoughtful structure, and an RSS feed that surfaces it all—and partners, readers, and search engines will recognize the care you pour into every update.</p>

        'content'      => <<<'HTML'
<p class="lead text-secondary mb-4">RSS may feel like a veteran technology, but its reliability, openness, and portability make it more valuable than ever for publishers who want to reach people without being locked into algorithms.</p>

<h2 class="h5 fw-semibold">Open distribution beats walled gardens</h2>
<p>Every platform tweak forces creators to relearn how to reach their audience. RSS, on the other hand, is a stable contract between you and your readers. When someone subscribes to your feed, you own that relationship forever. There is no mysterious ranking system, throttled reach, or unpredictable moderation queue. Readers decide when to unsubscribe, not a black box recommender.</p>
<p>For newsrooms and solo bloggers alike, that autonomy matters. RSS makes it trivial to syndicate the same updates to newsletters, Slack channels, Telegram bots, or podcast show notes. A single canonical feed becomes the distribution backbone across every channel you activate.</p>

<h2 class="h5 fw-semibold">Feeds power the modern research stack</h2>
<p>Professional researchers, analysts, and curators still rely on feed readers because they can harvest primary sources faster than any social network. Tools like Readwise Reader, Feedbin, and NetNewsWire summarize and archive hundreds of sources with minimal friction. When companies need competitive intelligence or academics track new publications, custom feeds turn the firehose into a manageable stream.</p>
<p>With SimpleFeedMaker, that capability extends to any public web page—even when a publisher doesn’t offer RSS themselves. Editors simply paste a URL, generate the feed, and drop it into their existing reader workflow. The result is a truly personalized research dashboard.</p>

<h2 class="h5 fw-semibold">Feeds respect your audience’s attention</h2>
<p>RSS delivers content exactly when a reader is ready to consume it, instead of interrupting them with notifications or autoplaying video. That makes feeds accessible for neurodiverse audiences, professionals working in focus mode, and anyone who prefers asynchronous updates. When subscribers use their own reader, they receive your headlines without invasive tracking pixels or bloated scripts.</p>
<ul class="page-list mb-4">
  <li><strong>Predictable cadence:</strong> Readers can triage their feeds once a day or once a week without fear of missing important updates.</li>
  <li><strong>Archivable content:</strong> A feed acts as a timeline that your subscribers can search, annotate, and export for later reference.</li>
  <li><strong>Privacy first:</strong> No cookies or pixels are required for delivery, which keeps you aligned with modern privacy regulations.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="h5 fw-semibold">Search engines still index feeds</h2>
<p>Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo continuously scan RSS and Atom feeds to discover new pages. Submitting a feed in Search Console or the IndexNow initiative gives crawlers a direct signal whenever you publish. That means faster discovery for new posts, products, and documentation updates without having to wait for the crawler to stumble across your site.</p>

<h2 class="h5 fw-semibold">The ecosystem keeps evolving</h2>
<p>Podcasting, Mastodon, and newsletter platforms all rely on feed technology under the hood. Podcast apps ingest RSS with custom namespaces for audio enclosures. ActivityPub exposes followable feeds for federated social accounts. Even platforms like Substack export RSS to keep creators portable. When you invest in high-quality feeds today, you automatically gain compatibility with tomorrow’s publishing tools.</p>

<h2 class="h5 fw-semibold">How SimpleFeedMaker keeps RSS frictionless</h2>
<p>Our generator fetches the target page, identifies structured content, and produces a clean RSS or JSON feed in seconds. Auto-discovery detects first-party feeds, while the crawler falls back to article extraction when needed. We cache results for performance and provide permanent URLs so subscribers can trust the feed right away.</p>
<p>The best part? You don’t need to manage servers or write scraping code. SimpleFeedMaker handles the hard parts and hands you a production-ready feed URL. That makes it the perfect companion for curators, community teams, and marketing managers who need fresh sources without development overhead.</p>

<h2 class="h5 fw-semibold">Your publishing stack deserves dependable feeds</h2>
<p>If you want to build direct relationships with readers, an email list and a high-quality feed are non-negotiable. RSS remains the most resilient way to deliver those updates without surrendering control to a platform. Whether you manage a newsroom or a niche blog, start generating feeds for every important source today and let your readers choose the tools that work best for them.</p>

<p class="lead text-secondary mb-4">Whether you manage a professional reading list or want alerts from a single landing page, SimpleFeedMaker converts any public URL into a clean RSS or JSON feed in minutes. This guide walks you through the process.</p>

<h2 class="h5 fw-semibold">1. Collect the URL you want to monitor</h2>
<p>Identify the page that updates with the content you care about: a blog category, a newsroom, a documentation changelog, or even a job listings grid. Make sure it is publicly accessible and loads without authentication. Copy the full URL directly from your browser.</p>

<h2 class="h5 fw-semibold">2. Generate your feed</h2>
<ol class="page-list mb-4">
  <li>Visit <a class="link-light" href="/">SimpleFeedMaker.com</a>.</li>
  <li>Paste the URL into the <strong>Source URL</strong> field.</li>
  <li>Adjust the <strong>Items</strong> count to match how many posts you want to keep in the feed. Ten is a great starting point for most sites.</li>
  <li>Choose your preferred <strong>Format</strong> (RSS for broad compatibility, JSON Feed for modern apps).</li>
  <li>Enable <strong>Prefer native feed</strong> if you want us to auto-detect first-party feeds when they exist.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Generate feed</strong>. Within seconds the result card displays your feed URL along with quick copy buttons.</li>
</ol>

<h2 class="h5 fw-semibold">3. Test the feed in your reader</h2>
<p>Before sharing the feed, subscribe from your own reader of choice—Feedbin, Inoreader, NetNewsWire, Readwise Reader, or any app that handles RSS or JSON Feed. Confirm that the latest items arrive intact and click through to ensure the links point to the correct destination. Because we cache content server-side, performance remains quick even if the source website is occasionally slow.</p>

<h2 class="h5 fw-semibold">4. Share or automate</h2>
<p>Once you are satisfied with the feed, put it to work:</p>
<ul class="page-list mb-4">
  <li><strong>Internal digests:</strong> Drop the feed into Slack or Microsoft Teams to broadcast updates to your team.</li>
  <li><strong>Newsletters:</strong> Pipe the feed into tools like Mailbrew or MailerLite to curate weekly roundups automatically.</li>
  <li><strong>Automation:</strong> Use Zapier, Make, or n8n to push new items to databases, spreadsheets, or social posts.</li>
  <li><strong>Syndication:</strong> Share the feed link with your community so fans can subscribe in their favorite app.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="h5 fw-semibold">5. Keep feeds tidy</h2>
<p>Feeds generated by SimpleFeedMaker refresh automatically, but it’s good practice to review them every few weeks. If the source site changes its layout, you can regenerate a fresh feed in seconds. You can also create multiple feeds for separate sections of the same site to keep topics organized.</p>

<h2 class="h5 fw-semibold">Troubleshooting tips</h2>
<p>Most pages work out of the box. If you run into unexpected results:</p>
<ul class="page-list">
  <li><strong>Pagination:</strong> Some catalogs load more items with infinite scroll. Grab a URL that lists the most recent entries without manual scrolling, or use the site’s “all posts” archive.</li>
  <li><strong>Paywalls:</strong> We only parse publicly accessible content. If the page requires login, you’ll need to syndicate a public summary page instead.</li>
  <li><strong>Frequency:</strong> For extremely busy sites, lower the item count so readers aren’t overwhelmed with hundreds of entries at once.</li>
</ul>

<p class="mb-0">That’s it—you now have a dependable feed for any site you follow. Ready to build your next one? <a class="link-light" href="/">Jump back to the generator</a> and turn another source into a feed.</p>

<p class="lead text-secondary mb-4">RSS 2.0 has powered the web for two decades, while JSON Feed offers a modern take on the same syndication ideas. Understanding how each format works helps you deliver the best experience to your subscribers.</p>

<h2 class="h5 fw-semibold">RSS 2.0 at a glance</h2>
<p>RSS is an XML-based standard that organizes channel metadata—title, link, description—followed by a list of items. Each item includes its own title, link, publication date, and optional fields such as author, categories, or media enclosures. Because RSS has existed since 2002, virtually every feed reader, podcast app, and automation toolkit can parse it without additional work.</p>
<ul class="page-list mb-4">
  <li><strong>Strengths:</strong> Excellent compatibility, namespaced extensions (like <code>itunes:</code> for podcasts), and built-in support for enclosures.</li>
  <li><strong>Considerations:</strong> XML can be verbose, and writing custom integrations often requires DOM parsing or XPath.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="h5 fw-semibold">JSON Feed in brief</h2>
<p>JSON Feed, introduced in 2017, reimagines syndication with a JSON structure. It mirrors the same concepts as RSS—feed metadata plus an array of items—but the familiar key-value format makes it easier for developers to consume. Common properties like <code>title</code>, <code>content_html</code>, and <code>date_published</code> map directly to JSON data types, which simplifies building modern web and mobile integrations.</p>
<ul class="page-list mb-4">
  <li><strong>Strengths:</strong> Lightweight payloads, effortless parsing in JavaScript or serverless functions, and native support for multiple authors without XML namespaces.</li>
  <li><strong>Considerations:</strong> Reader support is still growing, so legacy apps may not understand JSON Feed yet.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="h5 fw-semibold">How SimpleFeedMaker handles both</h2>
<p>When you paste a URL on SimpleFeedMaker, you can choose RSS or JSON Feed. Behind the scenes we extract the same content model—title, link, summary, body, author—and then render it through the desired format. That means you can provide RSS for compatibility while offering JSON Feed to developer audiences or modern readers.</p>
<p>We recommend publishing both formats whenever possible. RSS satisfies long-time subscribers, while JSON Feed makes it simple for product teams to integrate your updates into dashboards, native apps, or microservices without wrestling with XML.</p>

<h2 class="h5 fw-semibold">Choosing the right format for your audience</h2>
<p>If you need a single answer, start with RSS—it remains the lowest common denominator. Add JSON Feed when you want to collaborate with developer communities, automate workflows, or provide ultra-fast API responses. Because SimpleFeedMaker maintains the same feed ID across formats, you can swap between them or offer both without duplicating work.</p>
<p class="mb-0">Whichever format you choose, the goal is the same: deliver timely content that respects your reader’s attention. <a class="link-light" href="/">Generate a feed now</a> and make sure your audience has a format they love.</p>
