              <h1 class="h3 fw-bold mb-3">Why RSS Still Matters in 2025</h1>
              <p class="lead text-secondary mb-4">RSS may feel like a veteran technology, but its reliability, openness, and portability make it more valuable than ever for publishers who want to reach people without being locked into algorithms.</p>

              <h2 class="h5 fw-semibold">Open distribution beats walled gardens</h2>
              <p>Every platform tweak forces creators to relearn how to reach their audience. RSS, on the other hand, is a stable contract between you and your readers. When someone subscribes to your feed, you own that relationship forever. There is no mysterious ranking system, throttled reach, or unpredictable moderation queue. Readers decide when to unsubscribe, not a black box recommender.</p>

              <p>For newsrooms and solo bloggers alike, that autonomy matters. RSS makes it trivial to syndicate the same updates to newsletters, Slack channels, Telegram bots, or podcast show notes. A single canonical feed becomes the distribution backbone across every channel you activate.</p>

              <h2 class="h5 fw-semibold">Feeds power the modern research stack</h2>
              <p>Professional researchers, analysts, and curators still rely on feed readers because they can harvest primary sources faster than any social network. Tools like Readwise Reader, Feedbin, and NetNewsWire summarize and archive hundreds of sources with minimal friction. When companies need competitive intelligence or academics track new publications, custom feeds turn the firehose into a manageable stream.</p>

              <p>With SimpleFeedMaker, that capability extends to any public web page—even when a publisher doesn’t offer RSS themselves. Editors simply paste a URL, generate the feed, and drop it into their existing reader workflow. The result is a truly personalized research dashboard.</p>

              <h2 class="h5 fw-semibold">Feeds respect your audience’s attention</h2>
              <p>RSS delivers content exactly when a reader is ready to consume it, instead of interrupting them with notifications or autoplaying video. That makes feeds accessible for neurodiverse audiences, professionals working in focus mode, and anyone who prefers asynchronous updates. When subscribers use their own reader, they receive your headlines without invasive tracking pixels or bloated scripts.</p>

              <ul class="page-list mb-4">
                <li><strong>Predictable cadence:</strong> Readers can triage their feeds once a day or once a week without fear of missing important updates.</li>
                <li><strong>Archivable content:</strong> A feed acts as a timeline that your subscribers can search, annotate, and export for later reference.</li>
                <li><strong>Privacy first:</strong> No cookies or pixels are required for delivery, which keeps you aligned with modern privacy regulations.</li>
              </ul>

              <h2 class="h5 fw-semibold">Search engines still index feeds</h2>
              <p>Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo continuously scan RSS and Atom feeds to discover new pages. Submitting a feed in Search Console or the IndexNow initiative gives crawlers a direct signal whenever you publish. That means faster discovery for new posts, products, and documentation updates without having to wait for the crawler to stumble across your site.</p>

              <h2 class="h5 fw-semibold">The ecosystem keeps evolving</h2>
              <p>Podcasting, Mastodon, and newsletter platforms all rely on feed technology under the hood. Podcast apps ingest RSS with custom namespaces for audio enclosures. ActivityPub exposes followable feeds for federated social accounts. Even platforms like Substack export RSS to keep creators portable. When you invest in high-quality feeds today, you automatically gain compatibility with tomorrow’s publishing tools.</p>

              <h2 class="h5 fw-semibold">How SimpleFeedMaker keeps RSS frictionless</h2>
              <p>Our generator fetches the target page, identifies structured content, and produces a clean RSS or JSON feed in seconds. Auto-discovery detects first-party feeds, while the crawler falls back to article extraction when needed. We cache results for performance and provide permanent URLs so subscribers can trust the feed right away.</p>

              <p>The best part? You don’t need to manage servers or write scraping code. SimpleFeedMaker handles the hard parts and hands you a production-ready feed URL. That makes it the perfect companion for curators, community teams, and marketing managers who need fresh sources without development overhead.</p>

              <h2 class="h5 fw-semibold">Your publishing stack deserves dependable feeds</h2>
              <p>If you want to build direct relationships with readers, an email list and a high-quality feed are non-negotiable. RSS remains the most resilient way to deliver those updates without surrendering control to a platform. Whether you manage a newsroom or a niche blog, start generating feeds for every important source today and let your readers choose the tools that work best for them.</p>
