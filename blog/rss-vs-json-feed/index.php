              <p class="lead text-secondary mb-4">RSS 2.0 has powered the web for two decades, while JSON Feed offers a modern take on the same syndication ideas. Understanding how each format works helps you deliver the best experience to your subscribers.</p>

              <h2 class="h5 fw-semibold">RSS 2.0 at a glance</h2>
              <p>RSS is an XML-based standard that organizes channel metadata—title, link, description—followed by a list of items. Each item includes its own title, link, publication date, and optional fields such as author, categories, or media enclosures. Because RSS has existed since 2002, virtually every feed reader, podcast app, and automation toolkit can parse it without additional work.</p>

              <ul class="page-list mb-4">
                <li><strong>Strengths:</strong> Excellent compatibility, namespaced extensions (like <code>itunes:</code> for podcasts), and built-in support for enclosures.</li>
                <li><strong>Considerations:</strong> XML can be verbose, and writing custom integrations often requires DOM parsing or XPath.</li>
              </ul>

              <h2 class="h5 fw-semibold">JSON Feed in brief</h2>
              <p>JSON Feed, introduced in 2017, reimagines syndication with a JSON structure. It mirrors the same concepts as RSS—feed metadata plus an array of items—but the familiar key-value format makes it easier for developers to consume. Common properties like <code>title</code>, <code>content_html</code>, and <code>date_published</code> map directly to JSON data types, which simplifies building modern web and mobile integrations.</p>

              <ul class="page-list mb-4">
                <li><strong>Strengths:</strong> Lightweight payloads, effortless parsing in JavaScript or serverless functions, and native support for multiple authors without XML namespaces.</li>
                <li><strong>Considerations:</strong> Reader support is still growing, so legacy apps may not understand JSON Feed yet.</li>
              </ul>

              <h2 class="h5 fw-semibold">How SimpleFeedMaker handles both</h2>
              <p>When you paste a URL on SimpleFeedMaker, you can choose RSS or JSON Feed. Behind the scenes we extract the same content model—title, link, summary, body, author—and then render it through the desired format. That means you can provide RSS for compatibility while offering JSON Feed to developer audiences or modern readers.</p>

              <p>We recommend publishing both formats whenever possible. RSS satisfies long-time subscribers, while JSON Feed makes it simple for product teams to integrate your updates into dashboards, native apps, or microservices without wrestling with XML.</p>

              <h2 class="h5 fw-semibold">Choosing the right format for your audience</h2>
              <p>If you need a single answer, start with RSS—it remains the lowest common denominator. Add JSON Feed when you want to collaborate with developer communities, automate workflows, or provide ultra-fast API responses. Because SimpleFeedMaker maintains the same feed ID across formats, you can swap between them or offer both without duplicating work.</p>

              <p class="mb-0">Whichever format you choose, the goal is the same: deliver timely content that respects your reader’s attention. <a class="link-light" href="/">Generate a feed now</a> and make sure your audience has a format they love.</p>
